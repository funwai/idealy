PART I

Item 1. Business

General

We are a leading operator of retail discount stores operating under the brand names of Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada. At February 1, 2025, we operated 8,628 stores across 48 states and the District of Columbia and operated 253 stores across five Canadian provinces.

We believe the convenience and value we offer, as well as the “thrill-of-the-hunt” shopping experience where customers discover new celebratory and seasonal items every week, are key factors in serving and growing our base of loyal customers. We are committed to growing our business through new store openings, expanded geographies, improved product offerings, store renovations and remodeling, investments in our workforce and other initiatives to modernize and optimize our stores, our supply chain and distribution network and our technology. These initiatives are discussed further below and in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Discontinued Operations

Family Dollar stores provide customers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores, primarily serving a lower-than-average income customer in urban and rural locations. At February 1, 2025, the Family Dollar business included the operations of 7,622 general merchandise retail discount stores and ten distribution centers. 

As previously reported, in fiscal 2024 we initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. This strategic alternatives review concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in the decision to sell the Family Dollar business. Accordingly, the Family Dollar business met the held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management, LP and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, for a purchase consideration of $1,007.0 million, subject to a number of adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. The closing of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of U.S. antitrust approval. Net proceeds are estimated to total approximately $804.0 million.

Unless otherwise noted, the discussion throughout Part I of this Form 10-K, including the various metrics cited, excludes the Family Dollar business and pertains only to our continuing operations. For information on discontinued operations, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” and Note 15. 

Corporate Culture

Our core values drive how we treat our customers and each other to support a welcoming shopping experience and an engaging work environment. At every level of our organization, we build our culture by serving with accountability, inspiring belonging, championing empowerment, operating with excellence, and acting with integrity. We focus our ways of working on open, frequent communication and approach our roles with a continuous improvement mindset. Our communication vehicles foster two-way dialogue and offer continuous touchpoints for associates to hear about our strategy, values and ways of working, to learn from senior leaders about our business progress and connect with one another. Additionally, our people programs, as well as our meaningful focus on culture and belonging, reinforce our shared values and behaviors. For more information, see the “Our People” section below. 

Our Stores

Our stores serve customers with a broad range of income levels principally in suburban locations, striving continuously to “Wow” the customer with a compelling, fun and fresh merchandise assortment comprised of a variety of things the customer wants and needs, all at incredible values in bright, clean and friendly stores.

In our Dollar Tree stores, we continue to expand our brand assortment at the $1.25 price point to provide greater value to our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. We are continuing to expand our multi-price product assortment, which began with the introduction of $3 and $5 products in select discretionary categories, expanded into $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product, and now comprises a wide assortment of other consumable and discretionary product at varying price points. Through a partnership with Instacart, our customers can shop online and receive same-day delivery from more than 7,400 Dollar Tree stores, as of February 1, 2025, without having to visit a store.

In our Dollar Tree Canada stores, we generally sell items for $1.75(CAD) or less. Our revenue and assets in Canada are not material. 

We strive to exceed our customers’ expectations for product variety and quality by offering items we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere, and we believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise is critical to this end. In addition, direct

Table of Contents

relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging, product sizes and package quantities that best meet our customers’ needs. Merchandise imported directly typically accounts for approximately 40% of our total retail value purchases, with the remaining merchandise purchased domestically. Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of a vast majority of our direct imports and we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. Our domestic purchases include basic, home, closeouts and promotional merchandise. 

Our stores predominantly range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet. We carry approximately 8,600 items in our stores, and as of the end of fiscal 2024 approximately 33% of our items were automatically replenished. The remaining items are either allocated to the stores or managed by direct store delivery (“DSD”) vendors. Through automatic replenishment, store-specific allocations and DSD vendors, each store is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base.

We maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories. We offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these with seasonal, closeout and promotional merchandise. We attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase traffic in our stores. Closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10% of our purchases.

The merchandise mix in our stores consists of:

•Consumable merchandise, which includes everyday consumables such as household paper and chemicals, food, candy, health and personal care products, and in most stores, frozen and refrigerated food;

•Discretionary merchandise includes the following:

◦Variety merchandise, which includes toys, durable housewares, gifts, stationery, party goods, greeting cards, softlines, arts and crafts supplies and other items; and

◦Seasonal goods, which include, among others, Christmas, Easter, Halloween and Valentine’s Day merchandise.

For information regarding the amounts and percentages of our net sales contributed by the above merchandise categories for the last three fiscal years, please refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

Marketing & Retail Media

Our marketing mission is to surprise and delight our customer with great value, assortment, and treasure hunt excitement. We believe the customer experience is extremely important to our marketing plan success and our ability to drive incremental business. Our marketing efforts are primarily focused on driving store traffic by providing value to our customers through our new advanced digital targeting capabilities, genuine and authentic brand building via social influencers and posts, showcasing amazing assortment in our digital ads, creating a robust web and app customer experience, and utilizing in-store signage to help educate customers and drive conversion. 

Purchasing

We believe our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy, which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category. We also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners enables us to manage the margin impact of economic pressures. We primarily buy products on an order-by-order basis and have no material long-term purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost. Historically, no merchandise vendor has accounted for more than 10% of total merchandise purchased by the company.

Distribution

A strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a low-cost operating structure. We currently operate 15 distribution centers in the United States. New distribution sites are strategically located to reduce the distance between the distribution centers and stores, maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas. As part of our efforts to scale our distribution network to support future store growth, we plan to convert the Odessa, Texas Family Dollar distribution center to a Dollar Tree distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. We continue to make investments in our truck fleet, transportation management systems and a new RotaCart delivery process to streamline the truck unloading and store delivery process. A RotaCart is a wheeled container that allows quick, easy store deliveries loaded by merchandise category. The RotaCarts are nestable, allowing for easy return to the distribution centers.

Our stores receive approximately 90% of their inventory from our distribution centers. The remaining store inventory, primarily perishable consumable items and other vendor-maintained display items, are delivered directly to our stores from vendors or third party distributors. For more information on our distribution center network, see “Item 2. Properties.”

Distribution services in Canada are provided by a third party from two facilities, one in British Columbia and one in Ontario.

Seasonality

For information on the impact of seasonality, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Competition

We operate in the value retail sector, which is currently and in the future expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, and customer service, including merchandise delivery and checkout options. Our competitors include dollar stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, independently-operated discount stores, grocery stores and a wide variety of other retailers. These other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high-value, high-quality, low-cost merchandise in attractively-designed stores that are conveniently located.

Government Regulation

We are subject to a wide variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations within the United States and Canada. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, the operation of our facilities and the sale of products, including without limitation product and food safety, marketing and labeling; labor and employment, including wage and hour, benefits, healthcare and workplace safety; pricing; antitrust and fair competition; privacy and information security; tariff and trade; energy and environmental protection; financial reporting and disclosure; licensing; intellectual property; and taxes. We routinely incur significant compliance-related costs, both direct and indirect, with respect to these laws and regulations which may have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Intellectual Property

We are the owners of several trademarks including “Dollar Tree,” the “Dollar Tree” logo, and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in our stores. Our trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.

Our People

Our business success, customer satisfaction and employee engagement are built upon our dedicated associates who work and live in the communities we serve. Our goal is to provide a work environment that is welcoming and inclusive, offers competitive pay and benefits, supports growth and development, and affirms our corporate values. We recruit and hire in the communities we serve using associate referrals, local job fairs and social media as well as local community service partners to provide part-time and full-time jobs that can become lasting careers. Our Human Resources team, with oversight from our Board of Directors and its committees, develops and executes programs for compensation and benefits, onboarding and training, professional and leadership development, performance management, recognition and succession planning.

We show care for our people by investing in their personal well-being and professional growth through a variety of people programs and initiatives, including:

•Compensation, benefits and well-being. We are committed to providing market-competitive pay for all positions, and we are a pay-for-performance organization, offering performance-based compensation opportunities at nearly all levels of the organization, including certain hourly-paid positions. We strive to ensure gender and racial pay equity for associates performing equal or substantially similar work. Eligible associates can participate in our Retirement Savings Plan, which provides a dollar-for-dollar match on the first 5% of associate contributions, and all associates can participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. All full-time and part-time associates are eligible for health and welfare benefits, including medical, dental and vision. Associates may be eligible for other benefits including educational assistance, disability and life insurance as well as paid maternity and parental leave. Financial support to associates recovering from natural disasters and personal hardships as well as a scholarship program for associates with children pursuing higher education are also available. Associates are offered the flexibility to advance their payday earnings to meet their personal bills and expenses.

•Talent development and retention. We believe in the growth and development of our associates and are committed to building a culture of learning that gives associates the opportunity to enhance their skills at every stage of their career. To support this objective, we provide a multitude of professional and leadership development experiences, including online and instructor-led trainings, tuition reimbursement for graduate, undergraduate, General Educational Development (“GED”) and English as a Second Language classes, and discounted tuition at hundreds of colleges and universities for our associates and their families. Retention of our associates is a focus for all leaders and we continuously aim to improve our turnover rate. To identify high-potential individuals, leadership assesses talent at the store manager level and above on a regular basis through structured talent reviews and succession planning paired with customized development plans. In 

8

Table of Contents

fiscal 2023 we also started building our first leadership academy, focusing on our field district managers and setting the stage for similar programs for other groups of leaders throughout the organization.

•Culture and Belonging. Our goal is to create and support a culture of inclusion and belonging for each individual associate. We recognize that our customer base and the communities we serve are highly diverse, and we seek to create an environment in which the unique skills and perspectives of our associates and customers are understood, respected and appreciated. To further this goal, we have a Chief Culture and Belonging Officer (“CCABO”), which is a Senior Special Counsel role, on all matters related to Culture and Belonging. The CCABO is charged with creating and implementing strategies focused on corporate culture and the promotion of an inclusive environment in which all associates and customers feel welcome and valued, doing so in a manner consistent with our business goals and applicable law. In addition, we provide associate training on topics related to promoting a culture of inclusion and belonging and have formed a number of associate resource groups (“ARGs”). Each ARG is open to all associates. Our objective is to build a platform to encourage professional development, support community outreach and customer engagement, cultivate mentoring, attract talent from the communities we serve, and promote cross-functional teamwork for all associates. Each ARG is supported by an executive sponsor and a Human Resources partner to ensure efforts are aligned with the business.

•Workplace safety. Safety is a foundational part of our culture, embedded in all aspects of how we run our business. Our Asset Protection department, which includes Environmental, Health and Safety and Workplace Violence teams leads our comprehensive safety programming across all areas of our enterprise. Throughout the organization, we operate with a commitment to “Safety First, Safety Always,” with the shared understanding that a safe working environment is the responsibility of every associate. Through training and technology, we are able to implement measures that protect our associates and customers, and leverage predictive analytics to proactively identify and support stores in need of safety assistance. Furthermore, preventing incidents of workplace violence is a critical aspect of our safety program. Our comprehensive workplace violence prevention efforts focus on five foundational areas of training; investigation; response; prevention and community outreach.

•Communication and engagement. We believe that our associates are the most critical part of our business, and supporting an engaging culture where people can do their best work is a top priority for our leaders. In recent years we have added new channels to foster two-way dialogue and ensure we are listening to our associates and taking action on their feedback. A comprehensive strategic communication plan has been put in place to ensure our associates across the organization hear directly from our executive leaders on a regular basis to remain aligned with key priorities. Our annual associate engagement survey and semiannual pulse survey assess and highlight areas of focus that are important to our people, providing managers with quantitative and qualitative feedback directly from their teams. Our robust associate engagement survey process includes action planning to have meaningful impact on our continued cultural evolution. In addition, associates are encouraged to use our ethics hotline, known as Integrity Matters, to report concerns that they may have. Integrity Matters is a confidential reporting tool managed by an independent third party.

The number of associates we employed as of February 1, 2025 is as follows, including associates within the held for sale Family Dollar business:

Item 1A. Risk Factors

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Any failure to meet market expectations, including our comparable store net sales growth rate, earnings and earnings per share or new store openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline. You should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. However, the risks and uncertainties that we face are not limited to those described below and those set forth in our SEC filings. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also arise. In such event, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.

Profitability and Operational Risks

Our profitability is vulnerable to cost pressures from increases in merchandise, shipping, freight and fuel costs, wage and benefit and other operating costs.

Future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefit costs, ocean shipping rates, domestic freight costs, fuel and energy costs, tariffs, duties and other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, and store occupancy costs, whether due to inflation and economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, or otherwise, would reduce our profitability. For example, recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries could result in us incurring substantial additional costs to procure a large portion of the merchandise we offer. In addition, we have experienced increases in wage rates and labor costs and distribution costs in prior years, and we expect further increases in certain cost categories in fiscal 2025. In addition to pressures from a tight labor market, we have incurred additional costs as a result of recent minimum wage increases by certain states and localities, and we expect additional minimum wage increases by states and localities in fiscal 2025. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor finalized a rule in 2024 raising the minimum salary for associates to have exempt status under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Although the rule’s scheduled January 1, 2025 increase to the salary thresholds was recently vacated by a federal court, this or similar future rules could materially impact our wage rates and labor costs. Separately, government or industry actions addressing the impact of climate change, or shifts in customer preferences for more sustainable products, or our adoption of goals or initiatives aligned with related stakeholder expectations may result in increases in our merchandise or operating costs.

In our Dollar Tree segment, we continue to expand our brand assortment at the $1.25 price point and our multi-price product assortment generally, which began with the introduction of $3 and $5 Dollar Tree Plus product in select discretionary categories, expanded into $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product, and now comprises a wide assortment of other consumable and discretionary product at varying price points. Although we have increased our price points at our Dollar Tree stores and expanded our multi-price assortment, we may not be able to adjust our prices to offset cost increases. Further, raising the price point of merchandise could cause customers to buy fewer products. As a result, our ability to adjust our product assortment, to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset cost increases is critical to maintaining our profitability levels. Further, supply chain constraints and higher commodity costs could make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of certain products and could negatively affect our product assortment and merchandise costs. We can give no assurance that we will be able to adjust our product assortment, operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of the effect of economic factors on our operations.

Risks associated with merchandise supply could adversely affect our financial performance.

We are dependent on our vendors, including direct ship vendors, to supply suitable merchandise in a timely and efficient manner at favorable costs. If a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties, or if we are unable to source an expanded assortment of appropriate product to meet our merchandising strategies, we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used.

We rely on the timely availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices. Merchandise imported directly typically accounts for approximately 40% of our Dollar Tree segment’s total retail value purchases and approximately 12% of Family Dollar’s total retail value purchases. In addition, we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. Imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and result in higher profit margins. Any increase in the cost of our imported merchandise or a disruption in the flow of those goods for any reason could have an adverse impact on our operations and significantly decrease our profits. Disruptions or cost increases may result from factors such as:

•duties, tariffs or other measures that create barriers or restrictions on trade, including anti-dumping or countervailing duty orders or other trade-related sanctions and any retaliatory counter measures;

Table of Contents

•raw material shortages, work stoppages, government restrictions, strikes and political unrest, including any impact on vendors or shipping arising from epidemics;

•economic conditions in the United States or abroad; 

•geopolitical tensions, international disputes or conflicts, military confrontation, blockade, war, economic sanctions, piracy, acts of terrorism or other factors affecting international shipping traffic; changes in currency exchange rates or government policies and local economic conditions, including inflation (including energy prices and raw material costs) in the country of origin;

•potential changes to international trade agreements or the United States’ trade policies or trade relations with other countries from which we source merchandise; and

•changes in leadership and the political climate in countries from which we import products and their relations with the United States.

Among our foreign suppliers, China is the source of the majority of our direct imports. In early 2025, the United States imposed or threatened to impose significant additional tariffs, including reciprocal tariffs, on China, Mexico, Canada and other countries from which we import goods. In addition, the Trump administration has announced plans to impose significant fees on Chinese shipping companies and any Chinese-built vessels that enter U.S. ports. The imposition of these or other additional tariffs on imported merchandise or other actions against China or other countries from which we import goods, and any retaliatory actions or other responses by such countries, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales, an increase in our cost of merchandise or other adverse impacts on our operations, unless we are able to successfully offset or mitigate these impacts. Our mitigation efforts could include negotiating lower product costs, rebates or invoice deductions; shifting supply sources to alternate countries; changing our product assortment or discontinuing certain items; or increasing our prices. Even if we are able to mitigate the impact of tariffs in the short-term through one or more of the foregoing actions, a change in product assortment, reduced product offering or increase in pricing could reduce the competitiveness of our products, particularly if our competitors do not keep pace with any such changes or are able to offset the impact of tariffs through other actions.

Furthermore, in response to the recent tariffs announced by the United States, China and other countries have imposed or proposed additional tariffs on certain exports from the United States. These and any other retaliatory countermeasures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs, such as China, could increase our, or our vendors’, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by additional tariffs, the imposition of such additional tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing demand for our products. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or trade restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce recently has conducted investigations of anti-dumping and countervailing duties with respect to paper plates and aluminum pans. Based on determinations by the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission, we accrued $25.0 million related to additional duties on paper plates imported during fiscal 2024. Any additional duties related to these or other goods that we import could increase the cost of our imported merchandise and adversely impact our operations and profit margins. Please see “Our profitability is vulnerable to cost pressures from increases in merchandise, shipping, freight and fuel costs, wage and benefit and other operating costs” for further discussion of the effect of costs on our operations.

Higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability.

Our success is dependent on our ability to import or transport merchandise to our distribution centers and store, pick and ship merchandise to our stores in a safe, timely and cost-effective manner, and we are relying on a number of initiatives to improve upon our logistics execution, including new management systems. In addition to our internal distribution network, we also rely heavily on third parties including ocean carriers and truckers. Some of the factors that have had and could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are:

•Efficient operations and management. Distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are complex and difficult to operate efficiently. If we fail to execute properly, we may not be able to deliver merchandise at the quality and in the quantities and at the times demanded to successfully meet our customers’ demand. We have also experienced and could continue to experience challenges in attracting and retaining an adequate and reliable workforce. Although we have offered enhanced wages in certain markets to address the shortage of labor at our distribution centers, such measures have increased our costs and are expected to continue to increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability.

•Distribution center capacity. We recently have experienced capacity pressure in our distribution network and are working to expand our distribution center capacity, including to replace that lost with our Marietta, Oklahoma distribution center. To the extent that we are unable to, or experience delays in, opening new distribution centers or otherwise expanding our capacity, our product availability, product mix, overall sales, and merchandise margins could be impacted, especially at Dollar Tree.

•Shipping costs. We have previously experienced significant changes in freight costs. Ocean shipping and other freight costs could increase because of shocks or disruptions in the global supply chain and as freight contracts terminate or renew. A significant increase in our freight costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. A return to more normalized costs/rates may lag a decrease in market rates based on the timing of freight contract terms.

•Trucking and diesel fuel costs. We have experienced significant increases in trucking costs in recent years due to a truck driver shortage and other factors. The truck driver shortage also required us to increase our use of more expensive surge carriers to transport our merchandise.

•Shipping disruptions. We have experienced disruptions in the global supply chain, including issues with shipping capacity and port congestion, and could experience disruptions because of geopolitical tensions and other international events such as armed conflict, war, economic sanctions, piracy or acts of terrorism. Tensions in the Red Sea and traffic restrictions through the Panama Canal caused global supply chain disruptions in recent years and may continue, which could increase ocean shipping costs and transit times. Our receipt of imported merchandise has been and may in the future be disrupted or delayed because of these or other factors. Delays could potentially have a material adverse impact on future product availability, product mix, overall sales, and merchandise margins, especially at Dollar Tree.

•Labor disagreement. Labor disagreements, disruptions or strikes, including at ports, rail networks, transportation companies, or other parts of our distribution network may result in lost sales due to shipping delays or disruptions in the delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or stores and increase our costs.

•Vulnerability to natural or man-made disasters, including climate change. A fire, explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution or store support facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores. Some facilities are vulnerable to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or floods, and an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events and patterns may increase our operating costs, disrupt manufacturing or our supply chain, change customer buying patterns, result in closures of our stores or distribution and store support centers and impede physical access to our stores. During 2024, a tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. In addition to the loss of inventory in the facility and the facility itself, we incurred additional costs as a result of additional stem miles for product delivery and outside storage for the stores previously serviced by that distribution center, and we expect those costs to continue in 2025.

•Direct-to-store deliveries. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain consumable merchandise, including frozen and refrigerated products. To the extent that supply chain disruptions and higher costs affect our suppliers, we may be subject to delays or reductions in deliveries and higher costs for merchandise.

We may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related or other issues.

We may stop selling or recall certain products, including our private label brands and imported products, for safety-related or other issues, including product contamination, product content, improper manufacturing or distribution processes, improper testing, product mislabeling or product tampering. We may also stop selling or recall products if the products, the operations of our suppliers, or our operations violate applicable laws or regulations, including food, drug and cosmetic safety laws, or raise potential health and safety-related issues, including improper storage, product mishandling, contamination or other adulteration, or when products or their contents could cause injury, illness or death. Any recall may require significant management attention, and we could experience significant costs, lost sales, compliance or enforcement actions by governmental authorities which could result in fines or other penalties, and/or product liability legal claims and consumer lawsuits. Recalls may also subject us to public claims of false or deceptive advertising and other criticism. A significant product liability or other legal judgment against us, a regulatory enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. Additionally, any product recall may lead to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses.

We could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending because of concerns about the quality and safety of our products or our brand standards.

We could experience a decline in consumer confidence and spending if our customers become concerned about the quality and safety of the products we sell. The sale of private brand items has been an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans. The sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or increases certain risks, such as: product 

12

* * *

Table of Contents

liability claims and product recalls; disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains; supplier labor and human rights issues, and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. Failure to appropriately address these risks could materially and adversely affect our private brand initiatives, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

Inflation, other changes in economic conditions or consumer spending habits could impact our sales or profitability.

A deterioration in economic conditions could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably. Adverse economic conditions such as a recession could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns, or reduce our profitability due to lower margins. Other factors that could result in or exacerbate adverse economic conditions include inflation, higher unemployment, mortgage and interest rates, consumer debt levels, trade disputes, as well as adverse climate or weather conditions, worsening or new epidemics, terrorism, or international tensions, including armed conflict and economic sanctions. We believe that these macroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressures and higher interest rates, negatively affect our customers and impact our sales.

Furthermore, factors that could adversely affect consumer disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending on products we sell most profitably. In fiscal 2024, we continued to experience a material shift in consumer purchasing from higher-margin discretionary merchandise to lower-margin consumable goods, and we expect this trend could continue in 2025. Factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include inflation in food, housing, fuel or other energy costs, increased unemployment, increases in mortgage and interest rates, lack of available credit, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, increasing healthcare costs, and changes in government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (“SNAP”). If consumer spending on the goods we sell declines as a result, there could be a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Many of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, also affect our ability to implement our corporate strategy effectively and may have other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. We have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.

Our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably.

Existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors, including merchandise quality, price, relevance and availability, store operations and customer satisfaction. In addition, increased competition could adversely affect our sales. We have embarked on several initiatives to increase our sales and profitability, some of which remain in the early stages. If these initiatives are unsuccessful or we otherwise are unable to grow our sales in line with our expectations, our margins and profitability would be adversely affected.

In addition, we have entered into an agreement to sell the Family Dollar business. For more information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. If that sale is completed, our future growth and operating results will be dependent on our ability to increase sales and profitability in our Dollar Tree stores.

Expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms. We also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores. Obtaining an increasing number of profitable stores is an ever-increasing challenge.

In addition, our expansion is dependent upon the company and its third-party developers’ abilities to acquire land, obtain financing, and secure necessary permits and approvals. We have experienced higher construction, commodity and other costs associated with the build-out of new stores and the renovation of existing stores. We have also experienced delays in new store openings and the renovation of existing stores due to inspection, permitting and contractor delays. In addition, we have experienced delays in new store openings due to limitations on the availability of certain fixtures and equipment. We anticipate these increased costs and delays may continue for the foreseeable future, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Further, we may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell.

Our gross profit margin decreases when we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell. For example, some of our consumable products carry higher costs than other goods, so our gross profit margin will be negatively impacted as the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products increases. Imported merchandise and private label goods generally carry lower costs than domestic goods. Our product mix is affected by the supply of goods, including imported goods, and could be negatively impacted

Table of Contents

by various factors, including those described under “Risks associated with merchandise supply could adversely affect our financial performance” on page 10 and “Higher costs and disruptions in our distribution network could have an adverse impact on our sales and profitability” on page 11.

Our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices. We recently have been expanding our multi-price product assortment at Dollar Tree, which now comprises a wide assortment of consumable and discretionary product at varying price points. If our sales price that is too high, or we do not provide a selection of popular merchandising items, our products will be less attractive to our customers and our sales could suffer. We are continuing to refine our pricing strategy and expand our multi-price assortment at Dollar Tree to provide value to our customers and increase customer traffic and loyalty and store productivity. Our inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies or multi-price assortment and provide our customers with desirable merchandise at appropriate prices could have a negative effect on our business.

Our business is seasonal, and adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our full-year financial results.

Our highest sales periods are during the Christmas and Easter seasons, and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. In anticipation, we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores and help ship product from our distribution centers. Lead times for seasonal product purchases are longer and could result in inventory markdowns if sales do not meet expectations. A reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year. Untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect. When Easter is observed earlier in the year, the selling season is shorter and, as a result, our sales could be adversely affected. Easter was observed on March 31, 2024, and will be observed on April 20, 2025.

Failure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results.

Risk of loss or theft of assets, including inventory shrinkage, is inherent in the retail business and has recently reached historically high rates. We have incurred increased costs, and could continue to incur increased costs, as we make investments in technology and personnel in an attempt to mitigate these risks. Despite our efforts, loss may be caused by error or misconduct of associates, customers, vendors or other third parties including through organized retail crime and professional theft, and may be further impacted by macroeconomic factors, including the enforcement environment, or may be the result of damage or destruction of our inventory by natural disasters. We have experienced charges in the past, and our inability to cost-effectively prevent and/or minimize the loss or theft of assets, or to accurately predict and accrue for the impact of those losses, could adversely affect our operating results. 

We have risks related to the security of our facilities including risks of personal injury to customers or associates.

We operate stores and other facilities in locations subject to a risk for crimes of break-ins, theft, property damage, and interpersonal violence, which may include an active shooter or mass casualty/damage event. While we have instituted programs aimed at reducing these risks, particularly of workplace violence, no security or safety program is 100% effective, and there is a risk that they will not prevent the occurrences of such crimes or related harms. Any such incidents of violence could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, associate relations or customer reputation.

We face significant pressure from competitors which may reduce our sales and profits.

The retail industry is highly competitive with respect to price, customers, store locations, merchandise quality, product assortment, service offerings, customer service, shopping experience, product sourcing, labor, and market share. The marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of sales channels, store formats and merchandising strategies, including mobile and online shopping. To remain competitive, we may be required to change our product offering or lower our prices, but our ability to do so may be limited with the result that we could see lower sales or reduced profitability.

We expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. We compete with discount stores and many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online retailers, and certain specialty stores. Some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in e-commerce and expanded availability of mobile, web-based and other digital technologies has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models, and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create convenient and competitive online shopping alternatives. Some of our current and potential competitors have more significant online shopping platforms than we do, and our reliance on the in-store shopping experience could reduce our competitiveness. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, and we believe that doing so may require substantial capital expenditures, for example in technology. Our ability to effectively compete will depend upon our ability to successfully develop and execute on our strategic initiatives. Please see “Item 1. Business” for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.

Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage our organizational talent and capacity, including attracting and retaining qualified associates and key personnel.

Our growth and performance are dependent on the skills, experience and contributions of our associates, executives and key personnel. At our stores and distribution centers, we must recruit, develop, train, and retain qualified associates in relatively large numbers, while also working to decrease turnover in these positions. Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel, unemployment levels, wage rates and salary levels (including the heightened possibility of increased federal, state and/or local minimum wage rates/salary levels), health and other insurance costs, changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations (including those relating to employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs), labor activism, associate safety issues, associate expectations and productivity, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. If we are unable to attract, develop and retain adequate numbers of qualified associates, our operations, customer service levels, legal and regulatory compliance, and support functions could suffer. Further, our stores are typically staffed with relatively few associates, which increases our exposure to the foregoing risks. In addition, to the extent a significant portion of our associate base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor and other related costs could increase. The potential financial impact of union organization is further compounded by the possibility of federal agencies adopting or imposing changes to existing labor law that could facilitate union organizing. We currently do not have any employees represented by unions. Our ability to pass along labor and other related costs to our customers is constrained by our pricing model, and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business.

Successful execution of our plans and strategies also depends on the efforts of key management personnel. The labor market for these executives and other key personnel is nationwide in scope and intensely competitive. The loss of such personnel, or the inability to hire, train, motivate and retain them, or to manage changes to our organizational structure and capacity, could, at least temporarily, have an adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial condition. In addition, failure to develop an adequate succession plan for senior positions could reduce our organizational capabilities and competitive advantage during a transition. We recently have experienced turnover in senior positions, which, in addition to organizational changes related to our pending sale of the Family Dollar business, can disrupt progress in implementing business strategies, result in a loss of institutional knowledge, cause greater workload demands for remaining team members and divert attention away from key areas of the business, or otherwise negatively impact the company’s growth prospects or future operating results.

We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk.

Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, landlords, contractors, and external business partners. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and financial results. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.

Risks Relating to Strategic Initiatives and the Pending Sale of the Family Dollar Business

We may not be successful in implementing or in anticipating the impact of important strategic initiatives, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

In recent years, we have embarked on a number of strategic initiatives across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners to drive productive sales growth and improve operating efficiency. In our Dollar Tree banner, those initiatives include, among others:

•We continue to expand our Dollar Tree brand assortment at the $1.25 price point and expand our multi-price product assortment, which now comprises a wide assortment of consumable and discretionary product at varying price points.

•We secured the leases for 164 former 99 Cents Only Stores across Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas and opened those stores under our Dollar Tree segment. More recently we have acquired designation rights for approximately 138 Party City stores and as we complete our diligence on this group of stores, we intend to designate acceptable stores and open these as Dollar Tree segment stores.

•We have initiatives to provide competitive pay and benefits, enhanced training, and other projects to support our workforce as well as initiatives to optimize and modernize our stores. Our supply chain initiatives include optimizing our transportation network and distribution methods.

•We continue our significant investments in our technology across our business, including our mobile apps, store systems, merchandising and supply chain.

15

Table of Contents

In addition, we have been executing on a number of strategic initiatives in our Family Dollar banner, culminating with our agreement in March 2025 to sell the Family Dollar business. For more information about the impacts of the sale of Family Dollar, please see “The completion of the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in a timely fashion or at all, and the pending sale may be disruptive to our business operations and adversely affect our profitability” and “If the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is completed, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and the transaction may expose us to new risks” below.

The implementation, timing and results of these complex strategic initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in our planning. These initiatives place significant demands on our accounting, financial, information technology, and other systems, and on our business overall. We are dependent on our management’s ability to oversee these initiatives effectively and implement them successfully. If our estimates and assumptions about our initiatives are incorrect, or if we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete them or fail to execute on them effectively, our pursuit of these initiatives may increase our costs and reduce our margins and profitability.

To be effective, our strategies have and will continue to require significant investment in cross-functional operations and management focus, along with supporting investments. For example, we experienced increased expenses from temporary labor on the Dollar Tree segment during 2024 to support our multi-price rollout. If we are unable to attract and retain employees or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support our efforts, implement improvements to systems in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, if initiatives related to our multi-priced merchandise at Dollar Tree and improved customer experience do not appeal to our customers or if we are unable to consistently meet our brand execution promises in a cost-effective manner, we may experience a loss of customer confidence or lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.

A failure to properly execute our plans and business strategies, delays in executing our plans and business strategies, increased costs associated with executing on our plans and business strategies, or failure to identify alternative strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

The completion of the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in a timely fashion or at all, and the pending sale may be disruptive to our business operations and adversely affect our profitability.

As previously reported, in fiscal 2024 we initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management, LP and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, subject to regulatory review and other closing conditions. The pending sale of the Family Dollar business is subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses due to legal, advisory and financial services fees related to the sale. The majority of these expenses are payable by us regardless of whether the sale is consummated. Accordingly, if the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is delayed or is not completed on the terms set forth in the definitive purchase agreement or at all, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or stock price could be adversely affected.

In addition, the pendency and anticipated completion of the sale of the Family Dollar business may impose challenges on our business, including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns; impacts on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; attracting, retaining and motivating key management and other employees; retaining existing, or attracting new, business and operational relationships, including with suppliers and other business counterparties; potential negative reactions from the financial markets and other unanticipated adverse impacts; any of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

If the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is completed, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, and the transaction may expose us to new risks.

If the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is completed, our operational and financial profile will change significantly, with the Dollar Tree banner comprising substantially all of our retail operations. Our company following the sale would be smaller and less diversified than exists today, and our exposure to the risks inherent in our remaining business would increase. Our diversification of revenues, costs and cash flows would diminish, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and vulnerability to changing market conditions. Further, there can be no assurance that our credit ratings, access to financial markets and potential sources of liquidity and/or cost of financing would not be adversely impacted following the sale. As a result, our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Until the market has fully analyzed the value of the Dollar Tree banner as a separate company, the price of our common stock also may experience volatility.

Table of Contents

In addition, the sale of our Family Dollar business and other recent strategic initiatives entail significant changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. These changes have been and could continue to be disruptive to our business operations. Further, there can also be no assurance that the stranded costs or dis-synergies of such a transaction will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows, and we cannot assure you that the Dollar Tree banner, as an independent company, will be successful. 

Further, we expect to have continuing obligations to Family Dollar pursuant to transition services or other agreements in connection with the sale of the Family Dollar business, which could require significant management and operational resources or reduce our ability to fully realize cost savings and efficiency initiatives that we would otherwise be able to implement following such a disposition. While we anticipate receiving payment for the transition services that we provide, we may not be able to recoup all of the underlying costs.

We have incurred losses due to impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets.

Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. An evaluation is also performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred.

For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a $1,069.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and a $950.0 million non-cash trade name impairment charge resulting from our annual impairment testing and a $503.9 million non-cash store asset impairment charge related to our store portfolio optimization review. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a $490.5 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and a $1,400.0 million non-cash trade name impairment charge resulting from our annual impairment testing and an $88.1 million store asset impairment charge. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we determined that the Family Dollar business met the held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and recognized an impairment of $3,438.8 million to reflect the write-down of the carrying value to fair value less costs to sell. The Family Dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. Please refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Should we experience business challenges or significant negative industry or general economic trends, we could recognize additional impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our impairment analysis, and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate, we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation. Any reduction in or impairment of assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition. 

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Please refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and subject to changing conditions and other factors beyond our control. Accordingly, actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. 

For example, our liabilities related to our self-insurance programs, which include general liability claims, are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. As a result of unfavorable developments due to the rising costs to reimburse, settle, or litigate claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at our stores, our actuarially determined liabilities were increased during 2024, contributing to a $20.4 million increase in our general liability claim expenses compared to the prior year. Should these or any other estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations. 

Cybersecurity and Technology Risks

We rely on computer and technology systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those systems, including because of a cyberattack, could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.

We rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and, in certain cases, those of third-party service providers to support nearly all key functions in our business, including managing inventory, operating our stores, processing credit card and customer transactions, managing our customer and associate relationships and summarizing results. Our ability to effectively manage 

17

Table of Contents

our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the capabilities, confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems and on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate upgraded or replacement systems as needed to support our business requirements and strategic initiatives. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for many of these computer and technology systems and support.

Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us. This may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors, including through malicious software, ransomware and other cyberattacks, which may originate from state actors and may increase during times of international tensions. Failures may also be caused by various other factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, obsolescence or failure of vendor support, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers.

To support the growth of our business, we are making substantial investments in our information technology systems. Transitioning to these new or upgraded processes and systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources. Implementation is also highly dependent on the coordination of numerous associates, contractors and software and system providers. While these efforts have resulted in improvements to our operational systems, we expect to continue to incur expenses to implement additional improvements and upgrades to our systems. Many of these expenditures have been and may continue to be incurred in advance of the realization of any direct benefits to our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful at improving our operational systems, or that our efforts will result in the anticipated benefits to us. We may also experience difficulties in implementing or operating our new or upgraded operational or IT systems, including, but not limited to, ineffective or inefficient operations, significant system failures, system outages, delayed implementation and loss of system availability, which could lead to increased implementation and/or operational costs, loss or corruption of data, delayed shipments, excess inventory and interruptions of operations resulting in lost sales and/or profits. If our information technology systems, upgrades and associated change management are not adequate to support our business and our strategic initiatives, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and our business may become less competitive.

The potential unauthorized access to our systems could disrupt operations or lead to the theft of data which may violate privacy laws and could damage our business reputation, subject us to negative publicity, litigation and costs, and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, benefits, accounting, and internal and external communications, contain personal, financial, health-related or other confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates as well as proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers.

We are exposed to persistent and substantial risks from cybersecurity threats, as the number of cyberattacks targeting retailers and corporate networks grows, and the volume, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks, intrusions and threats from around the world increase daily. Both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents; however, to date, these incidents have not been material to our results of operations. The security measures that we and/or our third-party partners put in place cannot provide absolute security to prevent harm to our systems or safeguard our customers’ personal information (including debit and credit card information), our associates’ private data, suppliers’ data, and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information.

Cybercriminals, who may include well-funded state actors or organized criminal groups, are rapidly evolving their cyberattack techniques and tactics, which are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and challenging to detect. We and/or our third-party suppliers may be vulnerable to and unable to anticipate, detect, and appropriately respond to cybersecurity attacks, including data security breaches and data loss.

We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data of customers, associates, or others. These laws permit regulators to assess potentially significant fines for data privacy violations and may create a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations. Our efforts to comply with consumer privacy laws and other similar privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.

Likewise, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. As a Level 1 Merchant, we are subject to assessment and attestation for PCI-DSS compliance on an annual basis. A failure to meet and maintain compliance with PCI-DSS requirements could result in our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a form of payment, which would materially impact our ability to sell our products. In addition, our credibility and reputation within the business community and with our customers may be 

18

* * *

Table of Contents

affected, which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether. Non-compliance with PCI-DSS requirements also may subject us to recurring and accumulating fines until compliance is achieved. Considerable investments to strengthen our information security could also be required should we ever be deemed to be non-compliant. We are currently in compliance with the PCI-DSS standards.

Moreover, significant additional capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to continue to strengthen our overall cybersecurity posture and prevent future security breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and services (e.g., notification and credit-monitoring services) for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.

The unavailability of information technology systems on which we rely or the failure of those systems or software to perform as required to support our business needs for any reason and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such events, could disrupt our business, decrease performance, and increase overhead costs. If we, our vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business experience significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, stop using our applications or other programs, or stop shopping with us altogether. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition.

Legal, Regulatory and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Risks

Legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.

Our business is subject to the risk of litigation and other proceedings involving associates, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through private actions, class actions, derivative actions, governmental investigations, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, arbitrations or other similar actions.

In addition, our operations and/or the products we sell are subject to regulatory oversight by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, states’ attorneys-general, and other federal, state, local and applicable foreign governmental authorities. Where such authorities believe that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, they may require prompt corrective action, and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations in one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products, seizure of products, assessing civil or criminal sanctions or penalties, and requiring enhancements to our compliance programs or reporting requirements. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.

For example, in 2024 we resolved a previously disclosed investigation by the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) regarding a historical rodent issue at Family Dollar’s West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center (“DC 202”) and the related adulteration of products regulated by the FDA. Under this resolution, a Family Dollar subsidiary pled guilty to a one count misdemeanor violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 331(k), 333(a)(1) for causing FDA-regulated products to become adulterated and paid $200,000 in fines and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $41,475,000 to the United States. For a discussion of other impacts of this resolution, see also “Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us” below.

Our products could also cause illness or injury, harm our reputation, and subject us to litigation. Product liability, personal injury, consumer protection or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product adulteration, product tampering, mislabeling, recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell, or with respect to our handling or storage of such products. Recent such matters have led to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses. A significant product liability, consumer fraud, or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory compliance or enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. Moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our reputation. We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our vendors, where appropriate, or insurance coverage, and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors, for example because the vendors are overseas or lack financial resources. Our litigation-related expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.

The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these matters, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in an expense that may be material to our consolidated financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. If we experienced a material loss arising from these matters, we could also become subject to shareholder derivative suits and securities litigation. The cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings, including arbitrations, may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation, including litigation related to product or food safety, customer information and environmental or safety requirements, which could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.

For a discussion of current legal matters, please see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Contingencies.”

Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us.

We operate in an increasingly regulated environment across a large and diverse geographic footprint, and we devote substantial resources to ensure effective compliance with numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations. The complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs continue to increase due to additional legal and regulatory requirements, our expanding operations, and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts. New or revised laws, regulations, orders, policies and related interpretations and enforcement practices, including product and food safety, marketing, labeling or pricing; information security and privacy; artificial intelligence; labor and employment; employee wages and benefits; health and workplace safety (including Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules); imports and customs; taxes; bribery; climate change; and environmental compliance, may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially increase our cost of doing business.

If our programs do not adequately anticipate regulatory expectations or requirements, or if we fail to appropriately design and maintain an effective enterprise compliance program and system of controls to prevent and detect non-compliance, including implementing and communicating a strong culture of compliance, there is a possibility any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would subject us to enhanced legal risks and adverse outcomes. Violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in significant penalties (including loss of licenses, eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as SNAP or significant fines), class action or other litigation, governmental investigation or action and reputational damage. As part of our 2024 resolution of the DOJ investigation regarding DC 202, we agreed to implement improved internal controls, compliance codes, policies, and procedures, many of which were already underway or completed, and to make periodic reports to the DOJ for three years. The failure to properly manage our overall compliance program and fully comply with our obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in significant fines and other penalties, damage our brand and reputation, and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.

New laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, various municipalities have begun regulating the placement or proximity of our stores or may place requirements on labor relations or the types of products we sell. In addition, the adoption by certain jurisdictions of new or expanded environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products. These laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to, requirements relating to hazardous waste materials, recycling, single-use plastics, so-called “chemicals of concern,” extended producer responsibility, use of refrigerants, carbon pricing or carbon taxes, product energy efficiency, animal welfare standards and product labeling.

In addition, significant changes in laws or regulations that impact our relationship with our workforce, such as minimum wage increases, health care, labor relations laws or workplace safety, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. An increase in federal corporate tax rates also could adversely affect our profitability. Changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, product and food safety, energy or environmental protection, international labor protections, and tariff and other trade restrictions, among others, could cause our expenses to increase or result in product recalls.

Our business is subject to evolving disclosure requirements and expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters that could expose us to numerous risks.

Our business faces increasing public scrutiny related to social responsibility, climate change and other ESG practices. We risk damage to our brand and reputation, including risk to our plans for profitable growth, if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as worker safety and welfare, diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, and corporate governance and transparency. Conversely, if efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) are perceived as too ambitious, we may be subject to investigations, litigation and other proceedings and our brand and reputation and stock price may be harmed. Adverse incidents could impact the value of our brand, the cost of our operations and relationships with associates, customers or investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results.

In addition, regulators, customers, investors, associates, and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals regarding environmental matters, culture and belonging, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to mature, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. 

Further, the Supreme Court’s recent ruling striking down race-based affirmative action in higher education has increased scrutiny of corporate diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Some groups and attorneys general have begun to analogize the outcome of that case to private employment matters, asserting that certain corporate DEI practices are racially discriminatory and unlawful. Anti-ESG and anti-DEI related policies, legislation, initiatives and scrutiny could expose us to the risk of litigation, investigations or challenges by federal or state authorities, result in injunctions, penalties and reputational harm and require certain investors to divest or discourage certain fund investors from investing in our funds.

If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, if our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if our efforts around ESG-related issues are perceived as insufficient or too ambitious, consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected.

Risks Relating to Indebtedness and Our Common Stock

Our inability to access credit or capital markets, a downgrade of our credit ratings and/or increases in interest rates could negatively affect our financing costs, results of operations and financial condition.

We rely on internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program to fund our seasonal working capital requirements for existing and new stores, distribution network programs and other capital projects. In addition, we have $3.45 billion of senior notes outstanding as of February 1, 2025, of which $1.0 billion matures in May 2025.

Our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors, including market conditions, our operating performance and our credit ratings. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including as a result of financial market disruptions, rising interest rates, bank failures or other macroeconomic conditions, could increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Further, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of financing. Our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. A downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to credit and capital markets, limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us, result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our debt agreements and would likely significantly increase our overall financing costs and adversely affect our results of operations.

If we are unable to access financial markets when needed, on favorable terms or at all, whether to refinance our existing indebtedness on or before maturity or to fund our capital expenditures or working capital needs not satisfied by cash flows from operations, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, we have exposure to future interest rates based on variable rates under our revolving credit facility and issuances under our commercial paper program and to the extent we raise additional debt in the capital markets to meet maturing debt obligations or otherwise. Significant and sustained increases in market interest rates could materially increase our financing costs and negatively impact our reported results.

Our business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by shareholders.

We value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. The Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful. Shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change in the future, through various strategies that could include private engagement, publicity campaigns, proxy contests, and litigation. Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management, and associates, and impact our relationship with investors, vendors, and other third parties. Shareholder engagement also may result in changes to our business plans, operations, strategies, initiatives, governance, management, and risk

factors. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from these actions of shareholders could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.

The price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.

The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond our control, include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business; changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts, investors or us; trading activity by our large shareholders; trading activity by sophisticated algorithms (high-frequency trading); our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by us or our competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions or changes; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.

Certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest.

Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his/her best interest. These provisions, among other things, provide that only the Board of Directors, the chairman or vice chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer or shareholders who own 15% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock may call special meetings of the shareholders; establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders’ meetings; and permit the Board of Directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock. However, we believe that these provisions allow our Board of Directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

Risk Management and Strategy

We understand the importance of cybersecurity in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. Our business operations leverage information technology infrastructure and third-party vendors and systems which makes us susceptible to various cyber threats. We have implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management program to mitigate these risks and safeguard our assets.

We have measures in place to prevent, detect, and manage material risks from unauthorized access to our electronic information systems. These include various controls, technologies, and processes that protect confidential, proprietary, business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business operation.

We also consider cybersecurity, along with other business risks, within our enterprise risk management framework. Our assessment, identification and management of cybersecurity and data privacy risks are reported as part of our regular enterprise risk assessments, security audits and risk management programs. In addition, we leverage recognized consulting firms to conduct application security and penetration testing assessments annually. We also require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate employees, to undertake cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually. 

Our cybersecurity program utilizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework along with risk-based analysis and judgment, to choose the most effective security controls to address potential risks. We consider various factors such as likelihood and severity of risk, impact on our organization and others if a risk materializes, feasibility and cost of controls, and the effects of controls on our operations and others.

Because we rely on third-party providers and platforms for many of our computer and technology systems and support, we use a variety of processes and tools to address cybersecurity threats related to the use of third-party technology and services, including pre-acquisition diligence, imposition of contractual obligations, and performance monitoring. As a part of our monitoring, we regularly obtain System Organization and Control Reports (SOC Reports) for key third-party financial systems.

As part of our overall strategic initiatives, we have made investments in internal and external resources to support and enhance our technology infrastructure over the next several years. As part of this technology transformation, we plan to continue to invest in our information security team, enhance our cyber response plan and data privacy policies and evolve our third-party risk management program. In addition, in connection with our strategic review of the Family Dollar business, we are conducting a comprehensive

Table of Contents

reassessment of our cybersecurity posture. This evaluation focuses on how these changes affect our people, processes, and technologies. By doing this, we ensure the ongoing protection of sensitive data and critical assets, while also maintaining alignment with our security standards.

No material cybersecurity incidents occurred in fiscal 2024, but future incidents cannot be predicted. Additionally, in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the heading “Cybersecurity and Technology Risks,” forward-looking cybersecurity threats that could have a material impact on our business are discussed. Those sections of Item 1A should be read in conjunction with this Item 1C.

Although we have operational safeguards in place, we still face significant risks from cybersecurity threats, as the number of cyberattacks targeting retailers and corporate networks grows, and the volume, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks, intrusions, and threats from around the world increase daily. We (and third parties upon whom we rely) may be unable to implement security controls fully, continuously, and effectively as intended. As described above, we utilize a risk-based approach that focuses on proactively preventing security risks followed by prompt detection and containment of risks identified. Security controls, no matter how well designed or implemented, may only mitigate, and not fully eliminate risks. In addition, events, when detected by security tools or third parties, may not always be immediately understood or acted upon. If our technology systems, networks, or information are compromised by malicious software, ransomware, or other cyberattacks, we could lose critical data or confidential information of our customers, vendors or associates, experience disruptions in our ability to distribute and sell merchandise and manage inventories, incur substantial remediation costs and/or become subject to negative publicity, costly government actions or litigation.

Notwithstanding the deliberate approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured.

Governance

Our Audit Committee, which includes a member with cybersecurity experience, oversees our management of risks relating to information security and data privacy. At least semiannually, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing our risk exposures related to information security and data privacy with management. These management updates are designed to inform the Audit Committee of any potential risks relating to information security or data privacy and any relevant mitigation or remediation tactics being implemented. In addition, as part of our regular enterprise risk management assessments, cybersecurity risks are reported to and assessed by the Enterprise Risk Committee, comprised of senior leadership from key business functions.

To more effectively prevent, detect and respond to information security threats, we have a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) whose team is responsible for our overall information security, cyber risk, and business continuity. The CISO brings over 25 years of extensive experience in information technology and information security and serves as the designated executive leader for cyber or data-related incident response activities. Our CISO’s experience includes leading cybersecurity programs for Fortune 100 companies.

In addition to the CISO, the Chief Information Officer and Chief Legal Officer are responsible for overseeing risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy. Our Chief Information Officer’s experience includes more than 25 years of leading all information technology strategies and operations and oversight of IT systems for various Fortune 100 companies, and our Legal Department has personnel specializing in data privacy and cybersecurity who assist our team in assessing and managing cybersecurity risks.

We have a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan that is integrated into our crisis management program. The plan provides protocols for evaluating and responding to cybersecurity incidents, including incident disclosure and reporting, notification to senior management and relevant committees, and meeting external reporting obligations. The plan is reviewed and updated regularly by our CISO and Chief Legal Officer to ensure its continued effectiveness. We periodically perform tabletop exercises where we conduct walkthroughs of cyber incident situations to test our response plan, and we plan to continue testing on a periodic basis going forward.

Item 2. Properties 

As of February 1, 2025, we operated 8,628 stores across the contiguous United States and the District of Columbia and operated 253 stores within five Canadian provinces, with stores predominantly ranging from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet. For additional information on store counts and square footage for the last three fiscal years, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Overview.”

We lease substantially all of our stores and expect to lease substantially all of our new stores as we expand. Our leases typically provide for a short initial lease term, generally between five and ten years, with options to extend. We believe this leasing strategy enhances our flexibility to pursue various expansion opportunities resulting from changing market conditions. As current leases expire, we believe that we will be able to obtain lease renewals, if desired, for present store locations, or to obtain leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area.

Our network of distribution centers is strategically located throughout the United States to support our stores. As of February 1, 2025, we operated 15 distribution centers in the United States occupying a total of 14.1 million square feet. Except for 0.4 million square feet of our distribution center in San Bernardino, California and short-term leases for offsite facilities, all of our distribution center capacity in the United States is owned.

Each of our distribution centers use advanced material handling equipment, warehouse management systems, and radio frequency to track our inventory and ensure efficient operations. With the exception of three of our facilities, each of our distribution centers in the United States also contains automated conveyor and sorting systems. We previously disclosed that we were making significant investments to improve climate control conditions in our distribution centers; we now expect that all of our distribution centers will be climate-controlled within the first six months of fiscal 2025. 

Distribution services in Canada are provided by a third party from two facilities, one in British Columbia and one in Ontario.

Our store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia is located in an approximately 0.5 million square foot office tower that we own.

For more information on financing of our new, expanded and renovated stores, and distribution centers, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Funding Requirements.”

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we have been involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. For information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, please see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Contingencies.” For a further description of certain of these matters and their impact, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”: “Legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition” on page 19 and “Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us” on page 20.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including, factors that affect our business, analysis of annual changes in certain line items in the consolidated financial statements, expenditures incurred for capital projects and sources of funding for future expenditures. As you read Management’s Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 

During fiscal 2024, the Family Dollar business met the held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the results of operations of the Family Dollar business are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and the related assets and liabilities are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts, percentages and discussions below reflect only the results of operations and financial condition of our continuing operations. 

Overview

We are a leading operator of more than 8,800 retail discount stores, as of February 1, 2025, offering merchandise predominantly at the opening price point of $1.25, with additional offerings at higher price points.

Our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores. Second is the performance of stores once they are open which can be impacted by a number of factors including operational performance, competition, inflation, consumer buying preferences and changes in the product assortment, pricing, or quality. Sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded, relocated or remodeled during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. Stores that were converted from Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree stores are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the Dollar Tree brand. Additionally, sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable store net sales are referred to as non-comparable store sales and consist of sales from new stores open fifteen months or less and stores that are closed permanently or expected to be closed for more than 90 days.

2024 Financial Highlights

Financial highlights for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, as compared to the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, include:

•Net sales increased 4.7% to $17,565.8 million, due to a 1.8% comparable store net sales increase and net sales of $1.1 billion at non-comparable stores. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $307.0 million of the total net sales.

•Gross profit increased 4.5% to $6,281.7 million as a result of our net store growth. Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, remained unchanged in fiscal 2024 as the cost of sales rate is 64.2% in both fiscal 2024 and 2023.

•Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, increased 220 basis points to 27.5%.

•Operating income, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 230 basis points to 8.3%. 

•The effective tax rate increased to 24.7% compared to 23.8% in the prior year. 

•Income from continuing operations was $1,042.5 million, or $4.83 per diluted share, compared to $1,265.8 million, or $5.76 per diluted share.

Store Activity & Selected Sales Data

At February 1, 2025, we operated stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as stores in five Canadian provinces. The average size of stores opened in fiscal 2024 was approximately 10,990 selling square feet. A breakdown of the changes in store count and square footage is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

*Selling square footage impact of converted or relocated stores is only provided if it equals or exceeds 0.1 million selling square feet.  

The store counts above do not include new stores until they are opened for sales. Similarly, stores converted from a Family Dollar store to a Dollar Tree store, or vice versa, are reflected in the table above when they opened or closed, respectively.

Fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2022 which ended on February 1, 2025 and January 28, 2023, respectively, each included 52 weeks. Fiscal 2023 ended on February 3, 2024 and included 53 weeks, commensurate with the retail calendar. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 added approximately $307.0 million in sales. 

The percentage change in comparable store net sales, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Year Ended  
| | February 1, 2025| | February 3, 2024| | January 28, 2023  
Sales Growth| | 1.8 | %| | 5.8 | %| | 9.0 | %  
Change in Customer Traffic| | 1.6 | %| | 7.4 | %| | (3.9)| %  
Change in Average Ticket| | 0.1 | %| | (1.5)| %| | 13.4 | %  

Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded, relocated and remodeled stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores or expand stores near existing stores. The comparable store net sales change for the years ended February 1, 2025 and January 28, 2023 is based on a 52-week comparison for both periods included in the calculation. The comparable store net sales change for the year ended February 3, 2024 is based on a 53-week comparison for both periods included in the calculation. 

Net sales per selling square foot is calculated based on total net sales for the preceding 12 months as of the end of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period. Selling square footage excludes the storage, receiving and office space that generally occupies approximately 20% of the total square footage of our stores. We believe that net sales per selling square foot more accurately depicts the productivity and operating performance of our stores as it reflects the portion of our footprint that is dedicated to selling merchandise.

The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 contributed $4 to the total net sales per selling square foot. See our “Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments” below for more information on the initiatives that are driving our comparable store net sales growth and net sales per selling square foot growth.

Strategic Initiatives and Recent Developments

We continue to execute on a number of strategic initiatives to drive productive sales growth, improve operating efficiency, invest in technology, and expand our culture of service to our associates. These initiatives include, among others, and in no particular order, the following:

Dollar Tree Merchandising. We continue to expand our brand assortment at the $1.25 price point to provide greater value to our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. We are continuing to expand our multi-price product assortment, which began with the introduction of $3 and $5 products in select discretionary categories, expanded into $3, $4 and $5 frozen and refrigerated product, and now comprises a wide assortment of other consumable and discretionary product at varying price points. As of February 1, 2025, we had approximately 2,900 multi-price format stores, including approximately 2,600 conversions and 300 new stores.

99 Cents Only Stores Acquisition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired designation rights for up to 170 leases of 99 Cents Only Stores across Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas. The designation rights were acquired following the bankruptcy of 99 Cents Only Stores, which provided us an attractive opportunity to secure leases in priority markets. We secured the leases for 164 of these stores and substantially all have opened as Dollar Tree stores.

Our Workforce & Our Workplace. We are investing in our talent, including initiatives to provide competitive pay and benefits, enhanced training, and attractive career opportunities to deliver an enhanced associate experience, reduce turnover, and improve our store standards and efficiencies and ultimately the customer experience. Additional initiatives include projects to optimize and modernize our stores, with a focus on improving the in-store experience through renovations and customer service enhancements. 

Supply Chain Optimization. Our supply chain initiatives include expanding and enhancing our distribution and transportation network, including investments in our truck fleet, transportation management systems, a new distribution center with enhanced automation to improve efficiency, and a new RotaCart delivery process to streamline the truck unloading and store delivery process. Significant investments are also underway to improve climate control conditions in our distribution centers. These investments are expected to negatively impact gross margin in the near-to-mid term. 

Technology Investment. We continue our multi-year plan for significant investment in our technology across our business, including our mobile apps, human capital management system and supply chain system. We believe these improvements can promote operational efficiencies and deliver an elevated customer experience.

Marietta, Oklahoma Distribution Center. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a tornado destroyed our distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. Based on the significant damage sustained by the facility, the inventory contained in the facility and the facility itself are not salvageable. We have pivoted our supply chain network to deliver products to the approximately 600 Marietta-serviced stores, and we believe these efforts have limited and will continue to limit disruption to the Dollar Tree shopping experience. We are incurring additional costs within our supply chain as a result of servicing these impacted stores, including additional stem miles for delivered product and outside storage, and expect such costs to continue negatively impacting gross margin in the near-to-mid term.

General Liability Claims Development. Our self-insured general liability claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at our stores continue to develop unfavorably due to the rising costs to reimburse, settle, or litigate the claims. As a result, our actuarially determined liabilities were increased during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, contributing to a $45.3 million increase in our general liability claim expenses compared to the prior year second quarter. For the full year, fiscal 2024 general liability claim expenses increased $20.4 million compared to fiscal 2023.

The liabilities related to our self-insurance programs, which include general liability claims, are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions” later in this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more information on the estimates and assumptions related to these liabilities. Such estimates are inherently uncertain, and future changes in claim trends and assumptions could result in significant adjustments to our liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Family Dollar Store Portfolio Optimization and Strategic Alternatives Reviews. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review, which involved identifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of the portfolio optimization review, we identified approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024, and approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. As of February 1, 2025, we had closed approximately 695 stores identified under the portfolio optimization review.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced that we had initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business, which could have included among others, a potential sale, spin-off or other disposition of the business. This strategic alternatives review concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in the decision to sell the Family Dollar business. As a result, we concluded the Family Dollar business met the held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management, LP and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, for a purchase consideration of $1,007.0 million, subject to a number of adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. The closing of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of U.S. antitrust approval. Net proceeds are estimated to total approximately $804.0 million. For information on discontinued operations, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” and Note 15. 

Results of Operations

Our results of operations and year-over-year changes are discussed in the following section. Note that the cost of sales rate is calculated by dividing cost of sales by net sales. Gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less cost of sales) divided by net sales. The selling, general and administrative expense rate and operating income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue. Basis points, as referred to below, are a percentage of net sales for expense categories within gross profit and cost of sales, and are a percentage of total revenue for all other expense categories. A 100 basis point increase equals 1.00% and a 1 basis point increase equals 0.01%.

Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023

The increase in net sales from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 was a result of the comparable store net sales increase and net sales of $1.1 billion at non-comparable stores. Comparable store net sales increased 1.8% in fiscal 2024, as a result of a 1.6% increase in customer traffic and a 0.1% increase in average ticket. This increase is based on a 52-week comparison for both periods. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $307.0 million of the total net sales.

The low single-digit comparable store net sales increase was primarily impacted by the macro economic environment which continues to affect our customers due to the impact of inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. We expect these sales trends, and the resulting negative impact on operating income, to continue in the near-to-mid term.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

The increase in net sales from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was a result of the comparable store net sales increase and net sales of $467.1 million at non-comparable stores. Comparable store net sales increased 5.8% in fiscal 2023, as a result of a 7.4% increase in customer traffic, partially offset by a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. This increase is based on a 53-week comparison for both periods. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 accounted for $307.0 million of the total net sales increase.

Gross profit margin| | 35.8 | %| | 35.8 | %| | 37.5 | %| | — | %| | (1.7)| %  

Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023

Gross profit margin remained unchanged in fiscal 2024 as the cost of sales rate is 64.2% in both fiscal 2024 and 2023. Changes in the cost of sales rates consist of lower freight costs, offset by increased sales of higher cost consumable merchandise, increased occupancy costs resulting from the loss of leverage from the low single-digit comparable store net sales increase and the 53rd week of sales in 2023, higher distribution costs, increased shrink costs resulting from unfavorable inventory results, and increased markdown costs for slow moving items. Included in freight costs for fiscal 2024 is $25.0 million of duties related to an anti-dumping case for paper plates imported in fiscal 2024.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

Gross profit margin decreased in fiscal 2023 due to a 170 basis point increase in cost of sales. The cost of sales rate increased to 64.2% in fiscal 2023 from 62.5% in fiscal 2022 primarily due to re-investment in value-product assortments after transitioning to the $1.25 price point during the prior year, increased sales of higher cost consumable merchandise, higher distribution costs, increased shrink costs resulting from unfavorable inventory results, partially offset by lower freight costs and decreased occupancy costs resulting from the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of sales in 2023.

Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023

The selling, general and administrative expense rate increased 220 basis points in fiscal 2024 primarily due to higher depreciation expense from store investments, software impairments and related contract termination costs, temporary labor to support our multi-

price rollout, higher utilities costs, higher stock compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of the former Chief Executive Officer’s option award, the loss of leverage from the low single-digit comparable store net sales increase and the loss of leverage from the 53rd week of sales in the prior year. The software impairments and related contract termination costs totaled $58.0 million and were related to enterprise merchandising and store system projects that were not fully implemented and were cancelled in connection with the decision to sell the Family Dollar business.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

The selling, general and administrative expense rate increased 140 basis points in fiscal 2023 primarily due to wage investments and minimum wage increases in store payroll, unfavorable development of general liability claims, and higher repairs and maintenance expenses as we focus on store conditions for our customers and associates, partially offset by leverage from the comparable store net sales increase and leverage from the 53rd week of sales at the end of fiscal 2023.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

Operating income margin decreased to 10.6% in fiscal 2023 compared to 13.6% in fiscal 2022, resulting from the decrease in gross profit margin and an increase in the selling, general and administrative expense rate.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was 24.7% compared to 23.8% for fiscal 2023, resulting primarily from higher non-deductible executive compensation, increased tax expense in the current year related to restricted stock vesting and lower Work Opportunity Tax Credits.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.8% compared to 23.9% for fiscal 2022, resulting primarily from higher Work Opportunity Tax Credits, partially offset by higher tax expense in the current year related to restricted stock vesting.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We invest capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, enhance and grow our distribution network, operate our existing stores, maintain and upgrade our technology, and support our other strategic initiatives. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of September and October. We have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing and new stores and have funded our distribution network programs and other capital projects from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program.

The following table compares our cash flows for the last three fiscal years:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Year Ended  
(in millions)| | February 1, 2025| | February 3, 2024| | January 28, 2023

Financing activities of continuing operations| | (411.3)| | | (530.0)| | | (686.8)|   

Operating Activities

Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $207.5 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to lower current year earnings and increased inventory levels, partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable. The increase in inventory was the result of an increase in store count and inventory from our multi-price initiative. The increase in trade accounts payable was the result of extensions of payment terms with suppliers implemented in late fiscal 2023.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $982.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to decreases in inventory levels. Inventory was elevated at the end of fiscal 2022 due to global supply chain issues that resolved in fiscal 2023, resulting in lower payments for inventory.

Investing Activities

Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023

Net cash used in investing activities increased $54.6 million in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 due to higher capital expenditures in the current year, partially offset by insurance recoveries related to damaged property and equipment at our distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma as discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

Net cash used in investing activities increased $551.1 million in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 due to higher capital expenditures in fiscal 2023.

Financing Activities

Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $118.7 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to lower payments for stock repurchases in fiscal 2024.

Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $156.8 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower payments for stock repurchases in fiscal 2023. 

For detail on our long-term and short-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of “Funding Requirements” below, as well as Note 5 and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements.

Share Repurchases

We repurchased 3,283,837, 3,905,599 and 4,613,696 shares of common stock on the open market at a cost of $403.6 million, $504.3 million and $647.5 million, including applicable excise tax, in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. As of February 1, 2025, we had $952.4 million remaining under our existing $2.5 billion Board repurchase authorization.

Funding Requirements

Our total estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 are approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, including planned expenditures for supply chain investments, our new and expanded stores, store renovations, information technology investments, and other property improvements. We expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2025 to total approximately $445.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations, our commercial paper program and borrowings under our credit facilities.

Our material contractual obligations consist of long-term and short-term borrowings and related interest payments and operating lease obligations. Additionally, we have commitments related to ocean shipping contracts, software license and support agreements, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores. Other commitments include letters of credit for imported merchandise, standby letters of credit that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and surety bonds that serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. For additional information regarding these obligations, including amounts outstanding at February 1, 2025, refer to Note 5, Note 6 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.

Inventory Valuation

As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Merchandise Inventories,” inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.

Inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.

We estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.

Our accrual for shrink is based on the shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and October of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at February 1, 2025 is based on estimated shrink for most of fiscal 2024, including the fourth quarter. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described and, historically, these adjustments have not been material.

Our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.

Self-Insurance Liabilities

The liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general liability and auto are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. Semiannually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing these liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on our claims experience for current and prior periods, exposure and severity factors, historical loss development factors, and other actuarial assumptions and the related accruals are adjusted as management’s estimates change.

Management’s estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events. Our self-insurance liabilities associated with workers’ compensation, general liability and auto related to continuing operations are recorded within “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $244.3 million and $187.0 million at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively. Self-insurance liabilities related to discontinued operations totaled $185.0 million and $176.5 million at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively. The increases were primarily due to general liability claims developing and paying out at amounts significantly higher than anticipated, resulting in higher actuarially determined accruals.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. These assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.

For purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are Family Dollar, Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. We have the option to initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. In connection with the fiscal 2024 annual impairment evaluation, management’s qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Family Dollar reporting unit and the Family Dollar trade name were less than their carrying values. There were no indicators that the fair value of the Dollar Tree or Dollar Tree Canada reporting units were less than their carrying value. Therefore, management performed a quantitative assessment of both the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name.

In fiscal 2024, we estimated the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit by using market participant assumptions as there was an expected sale price for the business based on negotiations with potential third party buyers. Based on this fair value, we recognized an impairment loss of $490.5 million which represented the remaining carrying amount of goodwill from the Family Dollar business. The fiscal 2024 goodwill impairment was driven primarily by a decrease in enterprise value attributed to the Family Dollar business using the expected sale price compared to our carrying value. Our evaluation of goodwill resulted in an impairment charge of $1,069.0 million in fiscal 2023 related to the Family Dollar reporting unit. Our evaluation of goodwill did not result in impairment charges being recorded in fiscal 2022.

The Family Dollar trade name comprises a substantial portion of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and management’s judgment utilized in the Family Dollar trade name impairment evaluations is critical. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Family Dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. We estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. Royalty rates are derived using future estimates of earnings before interest, and taxes (“EBIT”), and a profit split analysis that examines how EBIT would be allocated to separate parties in an intellectual property license arrangement.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. Critical assumptions that are used as part of a tradename evaluation include:

•The potential future revenue, EBIT and cash flows of the reporting unit. The projections use management’s assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. The resulting revenue, EBIT and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. We believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.

•Selection of an appropriate discount rate. Calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. We engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the expected income under the relief of royalty method. The weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 10.5% for our fiscal 2024 analysis. The discount rate includes a premium due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets.

Our evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name resulted in impairment charges of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024 and $950.0 million in fiscal 2023. Our evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges being recorded during fiscal 2022. The fiscal 2024 trade name impairment was driven primarily by a decrease in the royalty rate assumption based on lower future growth rates and EBIT margin assumptions for the Family Dollar reporting unit.

For additional information related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements under the caption “Goodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets” and Note 15. For additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere within this “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges against earnings in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. 

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

A business is classified as held for sale when management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the business, the business is available for immediate sale in its present condition and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated. Additionally, the sale must be probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount and (ii) estimated fair value less costs to sell. When the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less costs to sell, a loss is recognized and updated each reporting period as appropriate. Assets held for sale are not further depreciated or amortized once such a determination is reached.

The results of operations of businesses classified as held for sale are reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the entity’s operations and financial results. When a business is identified for discontinued operations reporting: (i) results for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations; (ii) results of operations are reported in a single line, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations; and (iii) assets and liabilities are reported as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.

As previously noted, in fiscal 2024 we initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. This strategic alternatives review concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in the decision to sell the Family Dollar business. Accordingly, we concluded the assets of the Family Dollar business met the criteria for classification as held for sale. We determined the ultimate disposal will represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the results of Family Dollar are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and the assets and liabilities of Family Dollar have been reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The Company has ceased depreciating and amortizing its long-lived assets for Family Dollar which primarily includes right-of-use assets and property and equipment. On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management, LP and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, for a purchase consideration of $1,007.0 million, subject to a number of adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. The closing of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of U.S. antitrust approval. Net proceeds are estimated to total approximately $804.0 million.

We calculated an estimated loss on classification to held for sale of approximately $3.4 billion, reflecting the write-down of the carrying value of the Family Dollar business to fair value less costs to sell. The fair value was determined by using market participant assumptions as there was an expected sale price for the business based on negotiations with the buyer. Costs to sell included estimated incremental, direct costs incurred to transact the sale of the Family Dollar business. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies and our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes, diesel fuel cost changes and inflation. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to our revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program, and any future registered offerings of senior notes to raise new capital or replace existing maturities. At February 1, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or the commercial paper program.

Inflation Risk

The primary inflationary factors impacting our business include changes to the costs of merchandise, transportation (including the cost of diesel fuel), store construction-related costs, and labor. If these inflationary pressures become significant, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through adjustments to our product assortment, improvements in operational efficiencies or increases in our comparable store net sales. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Dollar Tree, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar Tree, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Evaluation of estimated self-insurance liability

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company considers actuarial assumptions to estimate its self-insurance liability. As of February 1, 2025, the Company recorded an estimated liability of $244.3 million related to continuing operations and $185.0 million related to discontinued operations.

We identified the evaluation of the estimated self-insurance liability as a critical audit matter. The estimation process involves auditor judgment and actuarial expertise to evaluate the actuarial methods and assumptions that are used to estimate future claim payments. Specifically, the evaluation includes the assumptions related to the loss development factors and expected loss rates which are primarily driven by historical claims paid and incurred data.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s self-insurance liability estimation process. This included controls related to (1) the selection of the actuarial methods, and the development of the loss development factors and expected loss rates used to calculate the liability, and (2) the completeness and accuracy of historical claims paid and incurred data. We assessed the Company’s estimate of the liability by testing a selection of certain data, including claims data, utilized by the Company’s actuary by comparing it to relevant documentation. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•evaluating the Company’s actuarial estimates and assumptions related to the loss development factors and expected loss rates, by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial methodologies and the Company’s historical data and trends.

Trade name intangible asset impairment

As discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs trade name intangible asset impairment testing on an annual basis and when events and changes in circumstances indicate possible impairment of the asset. To estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name intangible asset (Family Dollar trade name), the Company uses the relief-from-royalty method. The impairment charge for the year ended February 1, 2025 was $1,400.0 million for the Family Dollar trade name. 

We identified the evaluation of the Company’s fair value of the Family Dollar trade name as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name, specifically the revenue growth rates, discount rate, and company-specific royalty rate. Minor changes to certain of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the fair value and the resulting assessment of the carrying value of the Family Dollar trade name.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the intangible asset impairment process, including controls related to the determination and development of the identified assumptions. We assessed the Company’s ability to forecast by comparing the Company’s historical forecasts to actual results. We evaluated the revenue growth rates by comparing them to historical results and performing sensitivity analyses. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•evaluating the revenue growth rates by comparing them to publicly available market data for comparable companies

•assessing the discount rate by comparing it to a range of discount rates developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies

•assessing the company-specific royalty rate by comparing it to publicly available market data for comparable licensing agreements.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dollar Tree, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All amounts stated herein are in U.S. Dollars. Continuing operations consists of the Dollar Tree segment and corporate, support and other.

Our fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. References to “fiscal 2026,” “fiscal 2025,” “fiscal 2024,” and “fiscal 2022,” relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended January 30, 2027, January 31, 2026, February 1, 2025, and January 28, 2023, respectively. References to “fiscal 2023” relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2024.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 205-20 “Discontinued Operations,” a business is classified as held for sale when management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the business, the business is available for immediate sale in its present condition and an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated. Additionally, the sale must be probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions required to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount and (ii) estimated fair value less costs to sell. When the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less costs to sell, a loss is recognized and updated each reporting period as appropriate. Assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortized. 

The results of operations of businesses classified as held for sale are reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the entity’s operations and financial results. When a business is identified for discontinued operations reporting: (i) results for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations; (ii) results of operations are reported in a single line, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of operations; and (iii) assets and liabilities are reported as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale.

As previously reported, in fiscal 2024 the Company initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. This strategic alternatives review concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in the decision to sell the Family Dollar business. The Company concluded the assets of the Family Dollar business met the criteria for classification as held for sale during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Additionally, the Company determined the ultimate disposal will represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the results of Family Dollar are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. The assets and liabilities of Family Dollar have been reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The Company has ceased depreciating and amortizing its long-lived assets for Family Dollar which primarily includes right-of-use assets and property and equipment. On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management, LP and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, for a purchase consideration of $1,007.0 million, subject to a number of adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. The closing of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of U.S. antitrust approval. Net proceeds are estimated to total approximately $804.0 million.

Unless otherwise noted, all amounts and disclosures included in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reflect only our continuing operations. Refer to Note 15 for additional details on discontinued operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024 includes $1,050.9 million and $225.2 million, respectively, of investments primarily in money market securities which are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. In accordance with ASC Topic 305 “Cash and Cash Equivalents,” we consider all highly-liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of debit card and credit card transactions process within three business days, and therefore are classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Under our cash management system, payments issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within “Accounts payable” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the book overdraft position are presented within “Net cash provided by operating activities” within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount of these payments included in “Accounts Payable” as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024 was $155.5 million and $50.3 million, respectively. 

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes the cash flows of continuing and discontinued operations. The following is a reconciliation between “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Restricted cash” of continuing operations presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(in millions)| | February 1, 2025| | February 3, 2024  
Cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets| | $| 1,256.5 | | | $| 425.2 |   
Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets| | 75.7 | | | 72.3 |   
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of discontinued operations   
included in current and noncurrent assets of discontinued   
operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets | | 179.0 | | | 259.7 |   
Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the Consolidated  
Statements of Cash Flows| | $| 1,511.2 | | | $| 757.2 |   

Merchandise Inventories

In accordance with ASC Topic 330 “Inventory,” merchandise inventories at our distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on a weighted-average cost basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.

Costs directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized as merchandise inventories. Total warehousing and distribution costs capitalized into inventory amounted to $195.3 million and $166.9 million at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment

In accordance with ASC Topic 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment,” property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

| | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Buildings| 39 to 40 years  
Building improvements| 20 years  
Furniture, fixtures and equipment, software| 3 to 15 years  
Leasehold improvements| Shorter of remaining lease term or related asset life  

Depreciation is included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, with the exception of depreciation related to our merchandising and distribution-related assets which are included in “Cost of sales” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Capitalized Interest 

We capitalize interest on borrowed funds during the construction of certain property and equipment based on our weighted average borrowing rates in place while the projects are in progress. We capitalized $7.6 million, $5.9 million and $3.8 million of interest costs in the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. 

Insurance Reserves and Restricted Cash

We utilize a combination of insurance and self-insurance programs, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, general liability and auto. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, exposure and severity factors, historical loss development factors, and other actuarial assumptions. Our self-insurance liabilities associated with workers’ compensation, general liability and auto related to continuing operations are recorded within “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $244.3 million and $187.0 million at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively. Self-insurance liabilities related to discontinued operations totaled $185.0 million and $176.5 million at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively.

Dollar Tree Insurance, Inc., a South Carolina-based wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of ours, charges the operating subsidiary companies premiums to insure the retained workers’ compensation, general liability and auto exposures. Pursuant to South Carolina insurance regulations, Dollar Tree Insurance, Inc. maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its self-insured exposures.

We also maintain certain cash balances related to our insurance programs which are held in trust and restricted as to withdrawal or use. These amounts are reflected in “Restricted cash” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $75.7 million and $72.3 million at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively.

Lease Accounting

Our lease portfolio primarily consists of leases for our retail store locations, vehicles and trailers, as well as distribution center space and equipment. In accordance with ASC Topic 842 “Leases,” we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys the right to use an identified asset and whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and have the ability to direct the use of the asset. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with an initial term in excess of 12 months, we determine the initial classification and measurement of the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. ROU assets represent our right to control the underlying assets under lease, over the contractual term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the present value of future minimum lease payments to be made over the lease term. 

As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. Inputs to the calculation of our incremental borrowing rate include the valuations and yields of our outstanding senior notes and their credit spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates, adjusted to a collateralized basis by estimating the credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification. Most leases include one or more options to renew and the exercise of renewal options is at our sole discretion. We do not include renewal options in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably certain. Operating lease expense for lease payments not yet paid is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The operating lease ROU asset is reduced by lease incentives, which has the effect of lowering the operating lease expense. Operating lease ROU assets are periodically reviewed for impairment losses. We use the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10 “Property, Plant, and Equipment - Overall,” to determine whether an ROU asset is impaired, and if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize.

We have real estate leases that typically include payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, as well as payments for real estate taxes and insurance which are not considered components of the lease. These payments are generally variable and based on actual costs incurred by the lessor. These costs are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and excluded for the purpose of calculating the ROU asset and lease liability. A smaller number of real estate leases contain fixed payments for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the ROU asset and lease liability. In addition, certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These payments are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive financial covenants.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of

In accordance with ASC Topic 360, we review our long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on discounted cash flows or other readily available evidence of fair value, if any. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

In fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we recorded impairment charges related to continuing operations of $52.1 million, $10.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively, to write down certain assets. These charges are recorded as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2024, approximately $44.0 million related to capitalized software costs for enterprise merchandising and store system projects that were not fully implemented and were cancelled in connection with the decision to sell the Family Dollar business.

Refer to Note 15 for discussion of impairment charges recorded related to discontinued operations.

Goodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets

Goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets, including trade names acquired in business combinations, are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually. In addition, goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets are tested on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. For both goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets, we have the option to initially perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Alternatively, we may bypass the qualitative assessment in any given year and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. We perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year. Our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.” 

When a quantitative impairment test is performed for an acquired trade name, we compare the fair value, based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method, to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

When a quantitative impairment test is performed for goodwill, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. We recognize goodwill impairment for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

There were no impairments of goodwill associated with continuing operations in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Refer to Note 15 for information on goodwill and trade name intangible assets from discontinued operations, including the results of the impairment tests.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." Net sales consist of the net sales of merchandise in our stores. Revenue transactions associated with the sale of merchandise comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of promised products to our customers, which occurs at a point in time. Sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gift cards that we issue to customers are recorded as contract liabilities until they are redeemed in our stores, at which point revenue is recognized. We record reductions to revenue for discounts.

Cost of Sales

We include the cost of merchandise, warehousing and distribution costs, and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.

Vendor Allowances

We receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through various reimbursements such as purchase discounts, markdowns and volume rebates. We have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 705-20 “Accounting for Consideration Received from a Vendor,” we either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or defer the payment over the period the related merchandise is sold. If the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to the cost of merchandise.

Table of Contents

Pre-Opening Costs

We capitalize certain internal labor costs related to new, expanded, renovated, relocated and re-bannered stores after the project becomes probable and only when the costs are directly attributable to the preparation of the store-related assets for their intended use. We expense all other pre-opening costs related to our stores and distribution centers, as incurred.

Income Taxes

In accordance with ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes,” income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. We consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate.

We have made the policy election to record any liability associated with Global Intangible Low Tax Income ("GILTI") in the period in which it is incurred. 

We include interest and penalties in the provision for income tax expense and income taxes payable. We do not provide for any penalties associated with tax contingencies unless they are considered probable of assessment.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” which requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements over the service period. In addition, this guidance requires that excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards be reflected as operating cash flows. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair market value of stock option awards and grant date fair value for restricted stock units. We use the "simplified method" to estimate the expected life of options, as permitted by accounting guidance. The "simplified method" calculates the expected life of a stock option equal to the time from grant to the midpoint between the vesting date and contractual term, taking into account all vesting tranches. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield for the U.S. Treasury bill with a maturity equal to the expected life of the stock option. Expected volatility is based on our historical average. Compensation expense is recognized net of forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the total vesting period, which is the implied requisite service period, or a shorter period based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee. Compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the implied requisite service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable. We issue new shares upon exercise of stock options and upon vesting of restricted stock units. Refer to Note 10 for further details on stock-based compensation.

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with ASC Topic 260 “Earnings Per Share,” basic earnings (loss) per share has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of dilutive potential shares and has been computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding. Dilutive potential shares include all outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock units after applying the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations, diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock from discontinued operations and diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock include the effect of dilutive potential shares based on applying the control number concept in ASC Topic 260. The control number concept requires that the same number of potentially dilutive securities applied in computing diluted earnings per share from continuing operations be applied to all other categories of income or loss, even if the effect is anti-dilutive.

Foreign Currency

The functional currencies of certain of our international subsidiaries are the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located. In accordance with ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters,” foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations

and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. Capital accounts are translated at historical foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Adjustments that arise from foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions, primarily driven by intercompany transactions, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in “Other (income) expense, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. These adjustments have not historically been significant.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-04 "Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50)" ("ASU 2022-04") which requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs used in connection with the purchase of goods and services along with information about their obligations under these programs, including a rollforward of those obligations. We adopted ASU 2022-04 in fiscal 2023 on a retrospective basis, except for the amendments relating to the rollforward requirement, which we adopted effective February 1, 2025 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 14 for a discussion of our supply chain finance program and the rollforward of our outstanding payment obligations under the program.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”) which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. ASU 2023-07 also requires entities to disclose the title and position of the CODM and explain how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing performance and allocating resources. Further, it requires that all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 be provided in interim periods. We adopted ASU 2023-07 effective February 1, 2025 on a retrospective basis. Refer to Note 13 for our segment disclosures. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”) which requires entities to disclose specific categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as disaggregated disclosure of income taxes paid, pretax income and income tax expense by jurisdiction. The standard also removes certain disclosure requirements that currently exist under Topic 740. ASU 2023-09 is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning in fiscal 2025, with retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard to our consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 “Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income–Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”) which requires disaggregated disclosure of certain costs and expenses, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion, within relevant income statement captions. ASU 2024-03 is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning in fiscal 2027 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal 2028, with retrospective application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard to our consolidated financial statements.

Reinvestment of Unremitted Earnings

Substantially all of our current year foreign cash earnings in excess of working capital and cash needed for strategic investments are not intended to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Therefore, the tax effects of repatriation for applicable state taxes and foreign withholding taxes of such cash earnings have been provided for in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have the intent and ability to reinvest substantially all of the non-cash unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for state taxes or foreign withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Significant components of our net deferred tax assets (liabilities) follow:

At February 1, 2025, we had certain state tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $55.4 million. Some of these carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2044.

A valuation allowance of $11.6 million, net of federal tax benefits, has been provided principally for certain state credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes will not be realized. Based upon the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not the remaining existing deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which carrybacks are available or in which we generate net taxable income. 

Uncertain Tax Positions

We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”) for fiscal 2024 and we have been accepted into the program for fiscal 2025. This program accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our federal tax returns have been examined and all issues have been settled through the fiscal 2022 tax year. In fiscal 2020, we participated in the CAP under the IRS’s bridge year program and as a result, the IRS will not be completing an audit on the fiscal 2020 tax return at this time. Several states completed their examinations during fiscal 2024. In general, fiscal 2021 and forward are within the statute of limitations for state tax purposes. The statute of limitations is still open prior to fiscal 2021 for some states.

The balance for unrecognized tax benefits at February 1, 2025 was $28.2 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at February 1, 2025 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $23.1 million (net of the federal tax benefit).

The following is a reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits:

It is possible that tax reserves will be reduced for audit settlements and statute expirations within the next 12 months. At this point it is not possible to estimate a range associated with the resolution of these audits. We do not expect any change to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

As of February 1, 2025, we have recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $2.7 million.

Note 5 – Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Obligations

At February 1, 2025, we have commitments totaling $38.2 million through fiscal 2025 related to ocean shipping contracts and commitments of $299.2 million through fiscal 2034 related to agreements for software licenses and support, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores. 

Letters of Credit

We have $200.0 million in trade letters of credit with various financial institutions, under which $3.6 million was committed to these letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at February 1, 2025.

Surety Bonds

We have issued various surety bonds that primarily serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. These bonds total $129.3 million and are committed through various dates through fiscal 2027.

Contingencies

Insurance Claims

On April 28, 2024, a tornado destroyed our Dollar Tree distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma. Based on the significant damage sustained by the facility, the inventory contained in the facility and the facility itself are not salvageable. We incurred losses totaling $117.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, consisting of $70.0 million related to damaged inventory and $47.0 million related to property and equipment. These losses were fully offset by insurance receivables. As of February 1, 2025, we recorded additional insurance receivables of approximately $7.0 million for other property and equipment-related damage recoveries that we expect to be reimbursed under the terms of our insurance policy. As of February 1, 2025, we have received insurance proceeds totaling $150.0 million, including $100.0 million related to damaged inventory and $50.0 million related to damaged property and equipment. For the year ended February 1, 2025, we recorded a gain of $30.0 million for the excess of the insurance proceeds received over the losses incurred for damaged inventory, which is reflected within “Other (income) expense, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The foregoing losses and expected insurance recoveries are based on information currently available to us. We continue to assess these estimates and will recognize any changes to these estimates in the period(s) in which they are determined. The final losses, insurance recoveries and net charges could vary from these estimates.

Legal Proceedings

We are defendants in ordinary, routine litigation or proceedings incidental to our business, including employment-related matters; infringement of intellectual property rights; personal injury/wrongful death claims; real estate matters; environmental and safety issues; and product safety matters. Legal proceedings may also include class, collective, representative and large cases and

Table of Contents

arbitrations, including those described below. We will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. We do not believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or liquidity. We cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the quarter or year in which they are reserved or resolved.

We assess our legal proceedings monthly and reserves are established if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Many, if not substantially all, of our legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and the measurement of any loss can be complex and subject to judgment. With respect to the matters noted below where we have determined that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the possible loss at this time due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding legal proceedings. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Management’s assessment of legal proceedings could change because of future determinations or the discovery of facts which are not presently known. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than currently estimated.

Active Matters

Talc Product Matters

Multiple personal injury lawsuits are pending in state court in California, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, Texas, and New Jersey against Dollar Tree, Family Dollar or both alleging that certain talc products that we sold caused cancer. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages, damages for loss of consortium, and attorneys’ fees and costs. Although we have been able to resolve previous talc lawsuits against us without material loss, given the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurances regarding the outcome of pending or future cases. Future costs to litigate these cases are not known but may be material, and it is uncertain whether our costs will be covered by insurance. In addition, although we have indemnification rights against our vendors in several of these cases, it is uncertain whether the vendors will have the financial ability to fulfill their obligations to us.

Acetaminophen Matters

Beginning in August 2022, more than 50 personal injury cases have been filed in federal court against Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, or both, on behalf of minors alleging that their mothers took acetaminophen while pregnant, that the acetaminophen interfered with fetal development such that plaintiffs were born with autism and/or ADHD, and that we knew or should have known of the danger, had a duty to warn and failed to include appropriate warnings on the product labels. The plaintiffs seek compensatory, punitive and/or exemplary damages, restitution and disgorgement, economic damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. These cases, which originated in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas, along with other cases against many other defendants, were consolidated into multi-district court litigation in the Southern District of New York. The court disqualified plaintiffs’ experts and, on that basis dismissed all the cases which had been filed at the time of that decision, including all cases currently filed against us. The dismissal has been appealed to the Second Circuit by plaintiffs.

Short-Term Borrowings

Commercial Paper Program

In fiscal 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program to issue unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issue, up to a maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. The net proceeds of note issuances are used for general corporate purposes. The Company’s revolving credit facility, which is discussed below, serves as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes outstanding under the program. The notes rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. We issued and repaid $3.2 billion and $1.1 billion principal amount of notes in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively, and incurred interest expense of $3.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to these notes. At February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, no notes were outstanding under the program.

Revolving Credit Facility

The Company’s $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), of which up to $350.0 million is available for letters of credit, is currently set to mature on December 8, 2026. At February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility of $3.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively. We did not borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, we borrowed and repaid $555.0 million of loans under the Revolving Credit Facility and incurred interest expense of $3.6 million related to these borrowings. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the underlying credit agreement) plus 1.125%, subject to adjustment based on (i) our public debt rating and (ii) our leverage ratio. At February 1, 2025, the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at 5.54%. We pay certain commitment fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility allows voluntary repayment of outstanding loans at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) loans. 

The Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s ability to incur subsidiary indebtedness, incur liens, sell all or substantially all of our (including our subsidiaries’) assets and consummate certain fundamental changes. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio covenant and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. As of February 1, 2025, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Long-Term Debt

Senior Notes

The Company’s outstanding senior notes summarized in the table above are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, ranking equally in right of payment among themselves and with the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Company, at its option, may redeem each series of the senior notes at any time, in whole or in part, at

redemption prices set forth in the respective indentures. Additionally, upon certain events, the holders of the notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all outstanding senior notes is payable semiannually.

The senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur certain secured debt. As of February 1, 2025, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Note 8 - Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Financial assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). We review certain store assets for evidence of impairment. The fair values are determined based on the income approach, in which we utilize internal cash flow projections over the life of the underlying lease agreements discounted based on our risk-adjusted rate. These measures of fair value, and related inputs, are considered a Level 3 approach under the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 under the caption “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of” and Note 15 for further information regarding the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at carrying value, and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. Refer to Note 2 under the caption “Goodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets” and Note 15 for further information regarding the process of determining the fair value of these assets and the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Restricted cash” and “Accounts payable” as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The carrying values of our Revolving Credit Facility and borrowings under our commercial paper program approximate their fair values.

Note 9 - Shareholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share. No preferred shares were issued and outstanding at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024.

Share Repurchase Programs

We periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Under the existing Board repurchase authorization, we may repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions with financial institutions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date.

We repurchased 3,283,837, 3,905,599 and 4,613,696 shares of common stock on the open market at a cost of $403.6 million, $504.3 million and $647.5 million, including applicable excise tax, in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. As of February 1, 2025, we had $952.4 million remaining under our existing $2.5 billion Board repurchase authorization.

Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Fixed Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan permitted us to grant to our employees, consultants and directors up to 4.0 million shares of our common stock plus any shares available under former plans which were previously approved by the shareholders. The plan permitted us to grant equity awards in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, service-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance bonuses, performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), non-employee director stock options and other equity-related awards. As of March 17, 2021, the plan was no longer available for new grants of awards, but all outstanding awards that were granted under the plan prior to March 17, 2021 continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the plan and applicable award agreements. Effective June 10, 2021, the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan was replaced and superseded by the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“Omnibus Plan”). The Omnibus Plan permits us to grant up to 6.5 million shares of our common stock to our employees, consultants and directors. The form of equity awards authorized for grant under the Omnibus Plan are substantially the same as those permitted by the predecessor plan. 

Any restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs awarded are subject to certain general restrictions. The restricted stock shares or units may not be sold, transferred, pledged or disposed of until the restrictions on the shares or units have lapsed or have been removed under the provisions of the Omnibus Plan. In addition, if a holder of restricted shares or units ceases to be employed by us, any shares or units in which the restrictions have not lapsed will be forfeited.

Prior to July 1, 2023, the 2013 Director Deferred Compensation Plan permitted our directors to defer all or a portion of fees for Board or Board committee service until a future date, at which time they may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, or receive all or a portion of such fees in non-statutory stock options. Deferred fees that are paid out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate. Deferred amounts to be paid in common stock are determined by dividing the deferred fee amount by the closing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of deferral. The number of options issued to a director will equal the deferred fee amount divided by 33% of the price of a share of our common stock. The exercise price will equal the fair market value of our common stock at the date the option is issued. The options are fully vested when issued and have a term of 10 years. The 2013 plan expired on June 30, 2023. All amounts deferred by directors pursuant to the terms of the 2013 plan on or before June 30, 2023 will continue to be administered in accordance with the terms of the 2013 plan and applicable deferral elections.

Beginning July 1, 2023, our non-employee directors are permitted to defer all or a part of fees earned for his or her service as a director pursuant to our Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Program, which operates in conjunction with, and under the authority of, the Omnibus Plan. Pursuant to this program, cash fees may be deferred into either a cash account or a phantom stock account, and annual equity awards for service as a director may be deferred into the director’s phantom stock account. Deferred fees

that are paid out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate. Deferred amounts to be paid in common stock are determined by dividing the deferred fee amount by the closing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of deferral.

Total stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

The following discussion of our stock-based compensation awards includes awards related to continuing and discontinued operations. 

Restricted Stock

We issue RSUs to employees and officers and issue PSUs to certain of our officers. We recognize expense based on the estimated fair value of the RSUs or PSUs granted over the requisite service period, which is generally three years, on a straight-line basis or a shorter period based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee. For PSUs, the compensation expense recorded is re-evaluated at each reporting period and adjusted, as necessary, based on the probability of achieving the performance criteria. 

RSUs

The fair value of RSUs is determined based on our closing stock price on the grant date. The following table summarizes the status of RSUs as of February 1, 2025 and changes during the year then ended: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Number of RSUs| | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  
Nonvested at February 3, 2024| | 839,186 | | | $| 141.45 |   
Granted| | 668,169 | | | 131.89 |   
Vested| | (403,756)| | | 136.95 |   
Forfeited| | (130,466)| | | 140.71 |   
Nonvested at February 1, 2025| | 973,133 | | | $| 136.86 |   

The total fair value of the RSUs vested during the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 was $55.3 million, $53.8 million and $51.5 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of the RSUs granted in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $131.89, $141.70 and $158.05, respectively. As of February 1, 2025, there was $73.6 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the outstanding RSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

PSUs

Historically, we have granted PSUs that have a service and performance condition. The fair value of these awards is determined based on our closing stock price on the grant date. In fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we granted PSUs that cliff vest at the end of three years and that contain a market condition modifier, in addition to having a service and performance condition. The market condition modifier can adjust the number of shares that vest under the award based on a comparison of our total shareholder return to that of a designated peer group over the performance period.

Table of Contents

The fair value of these awards incorporating the market condition was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following weighted average assumptions:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Fiscal 2024| | Fiscal 2023  
Expected term (in years)| | 2.8| | 2.8  
Expected stock price volatility| | 34.7 | %| | 34.5 | %  
Dividend yield| | — | %| | — | %  
Risk-free interest rate| | 4.49 | %| | 3.82 | %  

The expected stock price volatility is based on the historical and implied volatility of our common stock over a period matching the expected term of the awards granted. The dividend yield reflects that we have never paid cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate represents the yield curve in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with maturities that approximate the expected term of the awards.

The following table summarizes the status of PSUs as of February 1, 2025 and changes during the year then ended: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Number of PSUs| | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value  
Nonvested at February 3, 2024| | 150,150 | | | $| 147.29 |   
Granted| | 178,579 | | | 114.98 |   
Vested| | (70,749)| | | 128.03 |   
Forfeited| | (40,864)| | | 151.60 |   
Nonvested at February 1, 2025| | 217,116 | | | $| 128.95 |   

The total fair value of the PSUs vested during the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 was $9.1 million, $8.7 million and $44.5 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of the PSUs granted in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $114.98, $129.24 and $159.57, respectively. As of February 1, 2025, there was $10.1 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to these PSUs which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. We assess the probability of the achievement of the remaining performance targets at the end of each reporting period and based on that assessment, cumulative adjustments may be recorded in future periods. 

Stock Options

Historically, we have not used stock options broadly as part of our compensation strategy. In fiscal 2023, we began to issue stock options to certain key executives. These awards generally have a ten-year term and vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the employees’ continued employment with the company through each vesting date. Stock options granted in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 had a fair value of $5.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively. 

In addition, in fiscal 2022, we granted a one-time award of options to purchase 2,252,587 shares of our common stock at a fair value of $135.6 million to the then Executive Chairman of the Board, who was also appointed Chief Executive Officer of the company effective January 29, 2023. The grant of options was subject to the terms and conditions of a five-year Executive Agreement. The option award has a ten-year term and was scheduled to vest in equal installments on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the Executive Chairman’s continued employment with the company through each vesting date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer resigned from the Company. As a result, $27.1 million of expense was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 related to the accelerated vesting of an additional number of options pursuant to the terms of the Executive Agreement. Vested portions of the award remain excercisable through the original ten-year term.

Stock options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Table of Contents

The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the executive stock options granted in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, as well as the assumptions used for the fiscal 2022 award granted to the former Executive Chairman are as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Fiscal 2024| | Fiscal 2023| | Fiscal 2022  
Expected term (in years)| | 6.0| | 6.0| | 6.5  
Expected stock price volatility| | 37.1 | %| | 36.3 | %| | 34.1 | %  
Dividend yield| | — | %| | — | %| | — | %  
Risk-free interest rate| | 4.36 | %| | 3.81 | %| | 2.15 | %  

The simplified method was used to estimate the expected term of the options due to our lack of historical option exercise experience and the “plain vanilla” characteristics of the option awards. The simplified method results in an expected term equal to the average of the weighted average time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period matching the expected term of the options granted. The dividend yield reflects that we have never paid cash dividends. The risk-free interest rate represents the yield curve in effect at the time of grant for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon securities with maturities that approximate the expected term of the options.

Prior to July 1, 2023, certain of our directors elected to defer their compensation into stock options under the 2013 Director Deferred Compensation Plan. These options vested immediately and were expensed on the grant date. 

The following tables summarize information about options outstanding at February 1, 2025 and changes during the year then ended:

Exercisable at February 1, 2025| | 1,669,653 | | | $| 156.55 | | | 7.1| | $| — |   

The intrinsic value of options exercised was less than $0.1 million in each of fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. As of February 1, 2025, there was $3.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to these options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

Note 13 – Segments and Disaggregated Revenue

As described in Note 2 under the caption “Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations,” as well as Note 15 below, effective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company no longer reports the Family Dollar segment; it now reports its financial performance based on the Dollar Tree segment and corporate, support and other. The Dollar Tree segment is a leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the opening price point of $1.25, with additional offerings at higher price points. Dollar Tree stores serve customers with a broad range of income levels principally in suburban locations. The Dollar Tree segment includes our operations under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands, 15 distribution centers in the United States and two distribution centers in Canada. Corporate, support and other consists primarily of store support center costs and the results of operations for our Summit Pointe property in Chesapeake, Virginia that are considered shared services and therefore these results are excluded from the Dollar Tree segment. 

Our CODM is our chief executive officer of the enterprise. The CODM evaluates the financial performance of the Dollar Tree segment using segment gross profit and operating income. The CODM reviews these metrics to allocate resources to the segment, primarily in the annual budget and quarterly forecasting process. The CODM considers variances between actual results and internal budgets/forecasts on a monthly basis for both profit measures when making decisions about allocating capital and resources to the segment. The CODM also uses segment gross profit to evaluate our ability to control product and supply chain costs relative to changes in sales between comparable periods. The CODM uses operating income to assess the overall performance for the segment. The CODM is provided asset information on a consolidated basis rather than by segment.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. We may revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the CODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period’s presentation. Corporate, support and other includes costs that were previously incurred in support of the Family Dollar segment but are not directly attributable to it and thus were not recorded in discontinued operations. Information for our segments, as well as for corporate, support and other, including the reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income taxes, is as follows:

Note 14 – Supply Chain Finance Program

During fiscal 2023, we implemented a supply chain finance program, administered through a financial institution, which provides participating suppliers with the opportunity to finance payments due from us. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to finance one or more invoices of ours prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price with the financial institution. 

Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decision to finance amounts under these arrangements. As such, the outstanding payment obligations under our supply chain financing program are included within “Accounts payable” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and within “Cash flows from operating activities” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, our outstanding payment obligations under this program were $346.5 million and $10.0 million, respectively.

The change in our outstanding payment obligations under the supply chain finance program is as follows:

Note 15 – Discontinued Operations

As previously reported, in fiscal 2024 the Company initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. This strategic alternatives review concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in the decision to sell the Family Dollar business. Accordingly, the Company determined the assets of the Family Dollar business met the criteria for classification as held for sale. Additionally, the Company determined the ultimate disposal will represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the results of Family Dollar are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of Family Dollar have been reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. On March 25, 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management, LP and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, for a purchase consideration of $1,007.0 million, subject to a number of adjustments, including with respect to working capital and net indebtedness. The closing of the transaction is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of U.S. antitrust approval. Net proceeds are estimated to total approximately $804.0 million.

Refer to Note 2 under the caption “Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” for additional details on accounting criteria for held for sale and discontinued operations treatment.

At February 1, 2025, the Family Dollar business included the operations of 7,622 general merchandise retail discount stores and ten distribution centers. The Company plans to convert the Odessa, Texas Family Dollar distribution center to a Dollar Tree distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. In addition, the Company intends to reassign approximately 330 leases for closed Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. As of February 1, 2025, we determined that the fair value of the Family Dollar business, including costs to sell was lower than its carrying value and we recorded a $3,438.8 million valuation allowance against the assets held for sale. The fair value of the Family Dollar business was estimated using the expected sale price as negotiated with the third party buyer. The non-cash valuation allowance was recorded within “Loss from classification to held for sale” in the summarized results of operations of discontinued operations for the year ended February 1, 2025. 

Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $439.4 million, $907.5 million, and $609.8 million for the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023, respectively.

Impairments

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we recorded impairment charges related to discontinued operations of $80.2 million, $500.6 million, and $38.7 million, respectively, to write down certain assets. These impairment charges are recorded as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the results of discontinued operations above. 

The fiscal 2024 impairment charges included $70.0 million of operating lease ROU asset impairment charges and $10.0 million of store asset impairment charges recorded in connection with our annual review of events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of store-related asset groups may not be recoverable. As a result of this review, we identified underperforming stores within the Family Dollar business that indicated that the carrying amount of their long-lived assets may not be recoverable.

The fiscal 2023 impairment charges included $343.9 million of operating lease ROU asset impairment charges and $149.2 million of store asset impairment charges recorded in connection with the store portfolio optimization review. This review was announced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and involved identifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of the portfolio optimization review, we identified approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024, and approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. As of February 1, 2025, we had closed approximately 695 stores identified under the portfolio optimization review. 

For the fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 impairment charges, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis on each individual store’s asset group, and determined that certain store asset groups had net carrying values that exceeded their estimated undiscounted future cash flows. We estimated the fair values of the asset groups based on a discounted cash flow method for each store and recorded an impairment for store asset groups where the fair value was lower than its carrying value. For stores that were to close in the first half of fiscal 2024 pursuant to the portfolio optimization review, we estimated the remaining fair value of the asset groups taking into account our ability to generate sublease income or lease termination benefits prior to the end of the lease term. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow methodology, which are based on level 3 inputs, include our expectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The valuation date for estimating the fair value of the long-lived assets at the stores for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 was November 30, 2024 and November 25, 2023, respectively.

In fiscal 2023, we also recorded $80.6 million of inventory markdowns and $5.6 million of capitalized distribution cost impairment within “Cost of sales” in the results of discontinued operations above related to the store portfolio optimization review. The operating lease ROU asset impairment recorded in connection with the store portfolio optimization review in fiscal 2023 did not relieve us of our monthly cash payment obligations under the leases. We continue to pursue lease terminations or subleases where practicable.

Trade Name and Goodwill Impairment

In connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and as a result of the decisions made around the strategic review, we determined it was more likely than not that an impairment loss had been incurred with respect to the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name, and proceeded to perform a quantitative impairment test of both assets. We estimated, with the assistance of a third party specialist, the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. The significant estimates used in the relief-from-royalty method, which are level 3 inputs, include estimates of future growth and revenue, a company-specific royalty rate, our weighted average cost of capital adjusted by a company-specific risk premium and trade name premium. The valuation date for the Family Dollar trade name was November 30, 2024. The results of the impairment test showed that the carrying value of the Family Dollar trade name exceeded its estimated fair value resulting in the recognition of a $1,400.0 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which is recorded as a component of “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the results of discontinued operations above.

Subsequent to the Family Dollar trade name and long-lived asset impairment tests, we estimated the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit using the expected sale price for the business as negotiated with potential third party buyers. The valuation date for the Family Dollar reporting unit was November 30, 2024. The annual goodwill impairment evaluation in 2024 showed that the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in the recognition of a $490.5 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the annual goodwill and nonamortizing intangible asset impairment evaluations resulted in the recognition of a $950.0 million trade name impairment charge and a $1,069.0 million goodwill impairment charge. The impairments were the result of the anticipated store closures under the store portfolio optimization review described previously. The fair value of the trade name was estimated, with the assistance of a third party specialist, based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. The significant estimates used in the relief-from-royalty method, which are level 3 inputs, include estimates of future growth and revenue, a company-specific royalty rate, our weighted average cost of capital adjusted by a company-specific risk premium and trade name premium. The fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was estimated, using the assistance of a third party specialist, using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. The significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow method, which are level 3 inputs, include our weighted average cost of capital adjusted by a company-specific risk premium, long-term rates of growth and profitability for the Family Dollar reporting unit, working capital effects, and changes in market conditions, consumer trends and strategy. The market multiple method utilized comparable public company revenue and profitability multiples to estimate the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit. The valuation date for the fiscal 2023 Family Dollar trade name and reporting unit was November 25, 2023.

The annual goodwill and nonamortizing intangible asset impairment evaluations in fiscal 2022 did not result in any impairment charges.

We have recorded cumulative goodwill impairment charges totaling $4,599.5 million, all of which relate to the Family Dollar reporting unit and were recorded during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 ($490.5 million), fiscal 2023 ($1,069.0 million), fiscal 2019 ($313.0 million), and fiscal 2018 ($2,727.0 million).

Note 16 – Subsequent Events

On March 21, 2025, the Company entered into a new revolving credit facility (“new Credit Facility”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, the banks and the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, providing for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, of which up to $350.0 million is available for letters of credit. The new Credit Facility matures on March 21, 2030, subject to extensions permitted under the new Credit Agreement (“new Credit Agreement”).

This new Credit Agreement contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants, similar to the prior Revolving Credit Facility.

In connection with entry into this new Credit Facility, we terminated all commitments and fulfilled all obligations under our previous credit agreement dated December 8, 2021.

Additionally, on March 21, 2025, the Company also entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, the banks and the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, providing for a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. The 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 20, 2026.

Note 17 – Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following table sets forth certain items from the Company’s unaudited consolidated statements of operations for each quarter of fiscal year 2024 and 2023. The unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report that reflect the results of Family Dollar as discontinued operations and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial data shown. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or for any future period.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Our management has carried out, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of February 1, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of February 1, 2025, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 

Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears below.

Changes in Internal Controls

In fiscal 2024, we implemented a new warehouse management system in two of our distribution centers and expect to complete a phased implementation of the system to our remaining distribution centers over the next several years. We have made changes to our internal control over financial reporting to align with the functionality and updated processes associated with the new system. We are also updating our human capital management system and expect to implement the new system in fiscal 2025. We will continue to monitor and modify, as needed, the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities to align with the updated business processes and capabilities of the new systems.

In fiscal 2024, we initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business. This strategic alternatives review concluded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and resulted in the decision to sell the Family Dollar business. We determined that the Family Dollar business met the held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. We designed and implemented responsive control procedures related to our financial reporting, which were assessed as of February 1, 2025 during the annual operation of these controls. 

There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended February 1, 2025 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Dollar Tree, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Dollar Tree, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

All amounts deferred by directors under the plan on or before June 30, 2023 continue to be administered in accordance with the terms of the plan and applicable deferral elections.
