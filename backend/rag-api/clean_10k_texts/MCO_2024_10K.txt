Sustainability

Moody's aims to deliver value to all stakeholders, including customers, employees, partners, communities, and stockholders. We consider sustainability in our operations, products, and services. We use our expertise to make a positive impact, helping others understand the link between sustainability and global markets. In 2024, Moody's received multiple awards for its sustainability efforts, including:

•Recognized among America’s 100 Most JUST Companies by JUST Capital and CNBC for its commitment to serving its workforce, customers, communities, the environment, and stockholders for its sustainability-related efforts;

•Made CDP's 2023 Climate Change 'A' List, in recognition of Moody's leadership in corporate transparency and actions taken in response to climate change;

•Named to the 2023 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices - World and North America, an annual listing of publicly traded companies, recognizing Moody's for its strong corporate sustainability practices; and

•Recognized as a 2023 CDP Supplier Engagement leader for the fourth consecutive year, ranking among the top 4% of companies assessed for supplier engagement on climate change.

The Board oversees sustainability matters via the Audit, Governance & Nominating, and Compensation & Human Resources Committees, as part of its oversight of management and the Company’s overall strategy. The Audit Committee oversees financial, risk and other disclosures made in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports related to sustainability. The Governance & Nominating Committee oversees sustainability matters, including significant issues of corporate social and environmental responsibility, as they pertain to the Company’s business and to long-term value creation for the Company and its stockholders, and makes recommendations to the Board regarding these issues. Finally, the Compensation & Human Resources Committee oversees inclusion of sustainability-related performance goals for determining compensation of all senior executives. The Board also oversees Moody’s policies for assessing and managing the Company's exposure to risk, including climate-related risks such as business continuity disruption and reputational or credibility concerns stemming from incorporation of climate-related risks into our credit rating methodologies, or analysis of such risks within our products and services. The Board maintains its collective knowledge of sustainability topics through ongoing education, such as regular presentations from management.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Our employees are vital to Moody’s continued success, and we seek to create an environment that attracts, develops and sustains a highly skilled, performance-oriented and engaged workforce. Our approach is oriented around the following pillars: 

–providing market-competitive compensation, benefits and wellness programs as part of our Total Rewards program; 

–implementing a robust talent management, employee engagement and retention strategy; and

–fostering an inclusive environment where all employees have a sense of belonging and are given the opportunity to perform their best.

Total Rewards

Moody's Total Rewards programs are designed to attract and maintain a high-performing, engaged and motivated global workforce. The Company's compensation packages include market-competitive salaries, performance-based annual bonuses, and equity grants aligned to our long-term performance for certain employees.

The Company's industry leading benefits programs offer comprehensive resources to support physical, mental and financial well-being. We invest in AI powered technologies in order to provide our employees with a world-class experience accessing and managing their benefits. We continuously evaluate our market benchmarks and employee feedback so that our benefits are competitive and support the attraction of the best talent. For example, in recent years we implemented a global paid parental leave policy to give parents time off to care for and bond with a new child and updated our tuition reimbursement program.

The Company also promotes flexible work arrangements, which support the Company's efforts to create a work atmosphere in which people feel valued and inspired to give their best. The Company has implemented a "PurposeFirst" framework, which fosters purpose-driven decisions relating to how and where Moody's teams work.

Talent Management, Employee Engagement and Retention

Moody’s believes that our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain a high-performing workforce. Our goal is to create an environment where colleagues can thrive personally and professionally and can maximize their potential. Our culture is one of continuous learning, which we believe is crucial for colleagues to thrive as part of our organization and to feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose, and our leaders are key in reinforcing this at Moody’s.

Moody's talent strategy helps us create integrated, cohesive talent activities that support the growth and success of our employees and the business. This strategy informs all of our talent programs, guiding our efforts to attract, develop and retain top talent. It also helps us remain aligned with Moody’s overall business objectives and values while designing programs to meet the evolving needs of our organization.

Moody’s offers various talent development programs and resources through Moody’s University that are focused on building professional, technical and leadership skills to support employees' goals and objectives. Moody’s also places significant emphasis on our high-potential and high-performance programs, which are designed to identify and nurture emerging leaders within the organization. These programs provide tailored development opportunities, mentorship and the chance to work on strategic projects that drive our business forward.

Moody's Employee Experience function conducts listening sessions with our employees and creates targeted plans to act on the feedback provided. We measure employee engagement via multiple channels, including the BES for employees to provide anonymous and candid feedback to management. This periodic survey helps Moody's management understand our employees' level of engagement in critical areas, which include, but are not limited to, purpose, leadership, managerial effectiveness, connection, enablement and empowerment and well-being. Managers are accountable for identifying opportunity areas and taking targeted actions based on survey results. The feedback received through the BES is used as a vital input into making decisions to improve employee experience and retention. As we strive to make Moody’s a place people want to come and stay, management also carefully monitors global employee turnover rates.

Inclusion and Belonging

Moody's believes that a workforce comprised of individuals with varied thoughts, backgrounds and experiences fosters an environment that makes our opinions stronger, our products more innovative, our workplace more welcoming and improves how we relate and respond to our customers. We are committed to cultivating a culture where every individual feels a sense of belonging and has an equal opportunity to succeed.

Our Inclusion Operating and Governance Model turns our inclusion strategy into reality by providing a functional framework to guide how our People team, councils, sponsors, BRGs and committees work together. The Global Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO and composed of senior leaders, is charged with oversight of our global inclusion strategy and its progress. The members of the council meet quarterly.

Our governance model also includes three Regional Inclusion Councils tasked with overseeing the inclusion strategy within their respective regions. Each council meets on a quarterly basis.

Our operating model includes 11 active BRGs which represent 48 chapters. These groups are open to all Moody's employees, with more than 4,800 employees participating globally as of December 31, 2024.

CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change is a major challenge that demands action from all of us. While Moody’s has a limited direct environmental impact, we do have an important role to play in demonstrating proactive corporate responsibility and best practices when it comes to climate change mitigation. As such, the Company is taking steps to reduce emissions across its operations and value chain in accordance with its decarbonization strategy.

Our decarbonization plan outlines tangible strategies for realizing our climate ambitions, including the procurement of 100% of renewable electricity in the Company’s office spaces and optimizing efficiencies in its operations through its hybrid work program. The costs associated with the implementation of the decarbonization plan are not expected to be material. 

The acquisition of RMS allowed us to expand our climate data and analysis capabilities. The Company continues to take steps to integrate these capabilities into existing offerings to provide its analysts and researchers with streamlined access to consistent and high-quality climate insights. Additionally, we have launched a Net Zero Assessment framework to provide an independent and comparable evaluation of the strength of an entity’s carbon transition plan.

PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH

Moody’s believes that the overall long-term outlook remains favorable for continued growth from the offerings of both of our reportable segments.

Moody’s growth is influenced by a number of trends that impact the market for our products, including:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | | | | | | | | | | |   
Enablement of Gen AI| | Health of the world’s major economies| | Debt capital markets activity| | Disintermediation of credit markets| | Fiscal and monetary policy of governments| | Expansion of market for integrated data and analytics solutions| | Business investment spending, including mergers and acquisitions  

In an environment of increasing financial complexity and exponential risk, Moody’s expects to be well positioned to benefit from continued growth in global fixed-income market activity and more widespread use of credit ratings and integrated risk solutions. Moreover, pricing opportunities aligned with customer value creation and advances in technology present growth opportunities for Moody’s.

Over the last decade, Moody’s has leveraged the power of AI and ML to better serve our customer base. As an early adopter of Gen AI, Moody's expects to be well positioned to benefit from the capabilities of this technology, which will help our customers make better decisions by unlocking deeper, more integrated perspectives on risk. Through enablement of Gen AI, both internally and through certain strategic partnerships, we are in the process of evolving how we deliver insights on exponential risk to our customers. 

Moody’s operations are subject to various risks, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” inherent in conducting business on a global basis. 

MA Prospects for Growth

MA provides insights on the evolving risks of our customers and supports their ability to capitalize on related opportunities. Growth in MA is likely to be driven by landing new customers and expanding customer relationships across use cases over time. Our trusted and curated data is key in an environment that is increasingly using Gen AI, and we expect that the integration of our platforms will enable effective cross-selling of models, data and applications. MA's growth is also likely to be driven by quickly addressing new use cases and incorporating new risk data and analytics as needed.

Market growth drivers: 

Customers need to understand a large range of interconnected and emerging risks. Our comprehensive solutions support the transformation underway across various industries due to: 

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Operational and reputational risks| | Digitization & Artificial Intelligence  
| Evolving regulatory environment| | Fluctuations in credit and financial markets  
| Climate change| | Geopolitical risks  

MIS Prospects for Growth 

Strong secular trends should continue to provide long-term growth opportunities in MIS. Key growth drivers include:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Long-term Growth Building Blocks  
| | | | | | |   
| Economic Expansion| +| | Value Proposition| +| | Developing Capital Markets and Evolving Risks  
•GDP growth drives demand for debt capital to fund business investments•Refinancing needs support future supply| •Proven rating accuracy and deeply experienced analysts•Mix of issuers and opportunistic issuance| •Deepening participation in developing markets•Meeting customers’ evolving risk assessment demands, including Sustainable and Transition Finance, Private Credit, Digitalization of the financial sector, and Cybersecurity  

In addition to the factors noted above, growth in global fixed income markets in a given year is dependent on many macroeconomic and capital market factors including: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | | | | | | |   
Interest rates| Business investment spending| Corporate refinancing needs| Merger and acquisition activity | Issuer financial health| Consumer borrowing levels| Securitization activity| Expansion of ratings coverage | Expansion into emerging markets  

Rating fees paid by debt issuers account for most of the revenue of MIS. Therefore, a substantial portion of MIS’s revenue is dependent upon the dollar-equivalent volume and number of ratable debt securities issued in the global capital markets. However, annual fee arrangements with frequent debt issuers, annual fees from debt monitoring, commercial paper and medium-term note programs, bank deposit ratings, insurance company financial strength ratings, mutual fund ratings, and other areas partially mitigate MIS’s dependence on the volume or number of new debt securities issued in the global fixed-income markets.

Within MIS, we remain firmly committed to ratings quality, timely and insightful research, and engagement with issuers and investors. In the past year, we have enhanced our footprint in domestic markets by increasing our majority share in the GCR Africa affiliate and expanding in Latin American markets through Moody's Local domestic rating business. This strategic expansion has solidified our domestic rating agency's position, enhancing its capacity and reach. 

Competition

MA competes broadly in the financial information and enterprise risk software industries against various diversified competitors. MA’s main competitors within DS are providers of software and analytic solutions. In R&I, MA faces competition from providers of economic data, financial research and analysis. MA's main competitors within D&I are providers of commercial and financial data.

MIS competes with other CRAs and with investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions and research. Many users of MIS’s ratings also have in-house credit research capabilities.

Regulation

MIS, certain of the Company's credit rating affiliates, and many of the issuers and/or securities that MIS and the affiliates rate, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. (including by state and local authorities), EU, U.K. and in other countries. In addition, some of the services offered by MA and its affiliates are subject to regulation in a number of countries. MA also derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight and who are required to conduct due diligence and pass through certain regulatory requirements to key suppliers such as MA by contract. Existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations, products and the markets in which the Company operates. Additional laws and regulations have been proposed or are being considered. Each of the existing, adopted, proposed and potential laws and regulations can increase the costs and legal risk associated with the Company’s operations, including the issuance of credit ratings, and may negatively impact the Company’s profitability and ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for the Company's products and services, in the manner in which the Company's products and services are utilized, and in the manner in which the Company operates.

In the U.S., CRAs are subject to extensive regulation primarily pursuant to Section 15E of the Exchange Act and rules thereunder. MIS is registered with the SEC as an NRSRO and is subject to the SEC's oversight and examination authority. 

In the EU, the CRA industry is registered and supervised through a pan-EU regulatory framework. ESMA has direct supervisory responsibility for registered CRAs throughout the EU. MIS’s EU CRA subsidiaries are registered with and are subject to CRA regulation in the EU and periodic inspection by ESMA.

The European Parliament and the Council of the EU, the EU co-legislators, announced they had reached agreement on the text of the Regulation on ESG Ratings Activities in February 2024. The Regulation will become law after it has been published in the EU Official Journal. The regulation will apply after an 18 month implementation period from its publication, and will subject ESG rating and/or score providers to formal regulation and supervision by ESMA. Certain products offered by MIS may fall in scope of the Regulation and we continue to assess and prepare for the implications. We do not expect MA products to fall into scope. 

The EU AI Act was published in the EU Official Journal in July 2024, though elements of the Act have different implementation periods. We continue to assess and prepare for any implications both for MA and MIS.

In December 2022, the EU adopted DORA, which will apply from early 2025. As a credit rating agency, MIS is in scope of DORA, and accordingly, is required to undertake certain steps to ensure that its oversight and risk management of its information technology, including any functions outsourced to third-parties that provide information communication technologies, is resilient. MA provides certain products and services to clients that may be regulated financial institutions in the EU and therefore fall in the scope of DORA. It is therefore expected that MA may receive queries from such clients in relation to those products and services, as well as requests for contractual commitments, to ensure their compliance with DORA. 

In the U.K., MIS U.K. is registered with and regulated by the FCA. In March 2023, the FCA initiated a review of competition in the markets for certain types of wholesale market data, including credit ratings data. The review concluded at the end of February 2024. In its final report, the FCA declined to make a market investigation reference to the Competition and Markets Authority nor did it consider any specific remedies or other specific interventions in respect of credit ratings data.

Additionally, HM Treasury published a consultation in March 2023 on whether regulation for providers of ESG ratings should be introduced, and the potential scope of a regulatory regime. The U.K. Government has said it intends to take forward such legislation in 2025.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in the Company’s securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the “forward-looking” statements discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.

The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results (including components of the Company’s financial results such as sales and profits), cash flows and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that Moody’s faces. The Company could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not consider to present significant risks. In addition to the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation and related monetary policy actions in response to inflation, changes in international conditions, including the impact of ongoing or new developments in the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the military conflict in the Middle East, and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below.

A. Legal and Regulatory Risks

Moody’s Faces Risks Related to Laws and Regulations that Affect the Financial Industry, Including the Credit Rating Industry, Moody's Businesses and Moody’s Customers.

Moody’s is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and by foreign jurisdictions. These regulations, the most important of which are discussed in further detail below, are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. Additionally, changes in the Presidential administration, changes in Congress, and recent judicial actions may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation or directives by government authorities. See “Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information.

Further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, including initiatives related to the emerging technology of AI systems, operational resilience, data privacy and climate-related risks, among others, that our products and services incorporate, and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect Moody's stock price, affect demand for our products and services, increase our costs of operations and impact our future business plans. Further, the Company's compliance and efforts to reduce the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses. Legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability.

Moody's Investors Service. MIS operates in a highly regulated industry. The current U.S. laws and regulations relating to MIS, including the Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act:

–seek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among CRAs and in the credit rating business;

–may result in alternatives to credit ratings, changes in the pricing of credit ratings, and/or diminished intellectual property protection relating to credit ratings and related research produced by MIS;

–restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;

–increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and CRA operations;

–provide the SEC with direct jurisdiction over CRAs that seek NRSRO status, and grant authority to the SEC to inspect the operations of CRAs; and

–provide for enhanced oversight standards and specialized pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs.

In addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations governing the credit rating industry, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to regulate CRAs and the markets for credit ratings that significantly impact the operations and the markets for the Company's ratings-related products and services. In particular, the EU has adopted a common regulatory framework for CRAs operating in the EU, continues to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation. The U.K. also has adopted a regulatory framework for CRAs that is based on the EU version. Credit ratings emanating from outside the EU are subject to ESMA's oversight if they are endorsed into the EU, and ratings endorsed into the U.K. are similarly subject to oversight of the FCA. Additionally, other foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia and Hong Kong and China, have taken measures to increase regulation of CRAs and markets for credit ratings. A failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements also exposes MIS to the risk of regulatory enforcement action which could result in financial penalties or, in serious cases, affect its ability to conduct credit rating activities in certain jurisdictions. For example:

–MIS is subject to formal regulation and periodic or other inspections in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions, such as, but not limited to, the U.K., Australia, Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong, where it operates through registered subsidiaries.

–In the EU and the U.K., applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to credit ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory analyst rotation requirements, and restrictions on CRAs or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed. Additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules regarding the organization of CRAs, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest, including requirements that fees be based on costs and non-discriminatory, special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments.

–In Hong Kong, applicable rules include liability for the intentional or negligent dissemination of false and misleading information and procedural requirements for the notification of certain matters to regulators. In addition, MIS Hong Kong is subject to a code of conduct applicable to CRAs that imposes procedural and substantive requirements on the preparation and issuance of credit ratings, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including the disclosure of its compensation arrangements with rated entities and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments.

–In China, while MIS is not a licensed CRA, it does issue global credit ratings on Chinese issuers from offices outside of China. In addition, the Company holds a 30% investment in CCXI, a domestic CRA licensed in China. China has laws applicable to domestic CRAs as well as foreign investment in such entities and entities in general (including national security review). 

–In Australia, unless an exemption applies, CRAs are required to hold an Australian financial services license (AFSL) if they carry on a business of providing credit ratings in Australia. MIS Australia holds an AFSL authorizing it to provide general advice to wholesale clients only by issuing a credit rating. It is therefore required to comply with obligations as an AFSL holder including the requirement to provide financial services efficiently, honestly, and fairly, to manage conflicts of interest, and to comply with the conditions of its AFSL (which conditions include specific conditions about credit ratings).

Future laws and regulations could extend to products and services not currently regulated. These regulations could:

–affect the need for debt securities to be rated;

–expand supervisory remits to include credit ratings issued outside the home jurisdiction;

–increase the level of competition for credit ratings, including the distribution of credit ratings;

–establish criteria for credit ratings or limit the entities authorized to provide credit ratings;

–restrict the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of information by CRAs; or

–regulate pricing (for example to require fees that are based on costs and are non-discriminatory) on products and services provided by MA such as those products that incorporate credit ratings and research originated by MIS.

In turn, such developments may affect MIS’s communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which MIS’s credit ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which MIS or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for MIS’s credit ratings or alter the economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for CRAs. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative

Table of Contents

and regulatory requirements on MIS’s business and its customers’ businesses. If these laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs, MIS may be unable to pass such costs through to customers. Additionally, legislative and regulatory initiatives that apply to CRAs and credit markets generally may affect Moody’s in a disproportionate manner. Each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on Moody’s operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized. 

Moody's Analytics. Certain of MA’s subscription products contain credit ratings data and related research produced by MIS, and often are used by MA customers for regulatory compliance purposes, including determination of capital charges and regulatory reporting.

Regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings and the activities of CRAs, including the dissemination of ratings data, are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including, for example, provisions regarding fair and reasonable availability of ratings data, the terms and conditions associated with such data feeds, remuneration for data and the nature of the information to be included in credit opinions. Other laws, regulations and rules are being considered or are likely to be considered in the future may impact MA products and services, for example, by requiring certain information to be provided free of charge. 

MA’s other products and services, in particular its offering of products and services relating to sanctions, KYC and financial crime, are potentially subject to various laws and regulations affecting the collection, processing and sale of data-driven solutions. These laws and regulations generally are designed to protect information relating to individuals and small businesses, including information used for consumer credit reporting purposes, the data rights of individuals, and to prevent the unauthorized collection, access to and use of personal or confidential information available in the marketplace and prohibit certain deceptive and unfair acts. Additionally, refer to the risk factor entitled “The Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Protection of Confidential and Personal Information.”

New laws and regulations are likely to be enacted and existing laws and regulations may change or be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is possible they will be interpreted and applied in ways that will materially and adversely affect our business. As a result of current and future laws and regulations, our customers’ and other third parties’ use of our products and services, as well as our use of information supplied by our suppliers and other third parties, can lead to regulatory inquiries or actions or related private litigation against us. Changes in the applicability of laws and regulations could require MA to modify its data processing practices and policies and restrict or dictate how MA collects, maintains, combines and disseminates information, which could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In the future, the Company may be subject to significant additional expense to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations applicable to MA and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations. Additionally, refer to the risk factor entitled “The Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Protection of Confidential and Personal Information.”

Further, MA’s bank and financial services customers are subject to additional regulatory oversight. For example:

–U.S. banking regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as many state agencies, have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with third-party relationships, which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity, by contract or otherwise, and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider’s business arrangement with third-party service providers, and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their third-party relationships. This guidance requires more rigorous oversight of third-party relationships that involve certain "critical activities."

–Regulators in Europe and other foreign markets in which MA is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the U.S. relating to financial institutions' assessment and management of risks associated with third-party relationships. For example, in December 2022, the EU adopted DORA, which will apply from early 2025 and will require EU financial institutions to have a comprehensive governance and control framework of the management of information and communications technology risks, including risks relating to third-party providers of technology and data such as MA. In light of this, MA’s existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with MA.

–In China, MA is licensed to provide subscriptions to credit research and ratings data and other information relevant to the financial markets. China has laws applicable to Moody’s that are broadly crafted, and the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of such laws are subject to the broad discretion of Chinese regulators, which could affect the Company’s ability to conduct business in China.

The EU AI Act has introduced a risk-based framework for regulating AI systems which applies different obligations to various actors in the AI supply chain. These rules apply to, among others, product manufacturers incorporating AI systems into regulated products sold into the EU as well as to providers whose AI systems or their outputs are made available in the EU. This Act will increase costs to MA including cost of establishing processes and procedures around applicability and implementation of the Act’s requirements for MA products and services. MA also faces a risk of cost of penalties or fines due to noncompliance.

MOODY'S 2024 10-K 25

Legal and regulatory developments can result in delayed or reduced sales to MA’s customers, adversely affect MA’s relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in MA assuming greater financial and legal risk under its agreements with such customers.

The Company Faces Exposure to Litigation and Government Regulatory Proceedings, Investigations and Inquiries (Including Competition Market Studies) Related to Rating Opinions and Other Business Practices.

Moody’s faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries (including market studies) related to MIS’s ratings actions, as well as other business practices and products within both MIS and MA. When the market value of credit-dependent instruments has declined or defaults have occurred, whether as a result of difficult economic times, rapid changes in interest rates, decreased liquidity, turbulent markets or otherwise, the number of investigations and legal proceedings that Moody’s has faced has increased significantly. Parties who invest in securities rated by MIS or issued by MIS-rated entities have pursued claims against MIS or Moody’s for losses they faced in their portfolios. For instance, Moody’s faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries (including market studies) concerning events linked to the U.S. subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during and after the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Evolving and/or inconsistent expectations regarding climate-risk and other sustainability disclosures and reporting could also result in increased regulatory scrutiny and new regulatory actions at a corporate and business unit level. MA’s offering of products and services relating to sanctions, KYC and financial crime may result in increased regulatory scrutiny and could expose the Company to increased risk of litigation from data subjects and other third-parties, including due to potential inaccuracies in the products and services we offer, as well as regulatory recordkeeping requirements associated with our services. Additionally, as Moody’s develops its Gen AI product offerings and/or increases its use of Gen AI, the Company may face increased regulatory scrutiny and exposure to increased litigation. Legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and investigations impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues, and any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries (including market studies) could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions. Risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the U.S. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. Moody’s may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Furthermore, when Moody’s is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by Moody’s increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome.

Additionally, as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progress, Moody’s will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates, which could require Moody’s to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the Company currently faces. Due to the potential number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages that could be sought, there is a risk that Moody’s will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Its Compliance and Risk Management Programs.

Moody’s operates in a number of countries, and as a result the Company is required to comply with and quickly adapt to numerous international and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. The Company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, antitrust, economic and trade sanctions, and securities trading laws, the Reform Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations thereunder, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel. Moody’s policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the Company’s risks, including risks resulting from acquisitions and from Gen AI developments (such as maintaining the quality and integrity of data of Gen AI product offerings), may not be fully effective, and Moody’s employees or agents may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. It is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. If Moody’s employees violate its policies or if the Company’s risk management methods are not effective, the Company may be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of the Company’s employees, fines, penalties, regulatory sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets or other penalties, and may suffer harm to its reputation, financial condition and operating results.

Moody’s Faces Risks Related to Protecting Its Intellectual Property Rights.

Moody’s considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect the Company’s intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the Company’s ability to compete effectively. Businesses the Company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges the Company faces in protecting its strategic advantage. In addition, the Company’s operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets, including if and how rights in these markets evolve to address unauthorized or unintended use of intellectual property from new technologies like Gen AI. The lack of strong legal and technological intellectual property protections in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may increase our vulnerability and may pose risks to our business. From time to time, laws are passed that require publication of certain information, in some cases at no cost, that the Company considers to be its intellectual property and that it currently sells or licenses for a fee, which could result in lost revenue.

26 MOODY'S 2024 10-K

Table of Contents

Unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the Company regards as proprietary. It is also possible that Moody’s competitors or other entities could obtain patents or other intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services that Moody’s offers, and attempt to require Moody’s to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing, or to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services. Even if Moody’s attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. The Company’s ability to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft, misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient and/or changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets. These risks, and the cost, time and resources needed to address them, may increase as the Company’s business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the United States.

Moody’s Faces Risks Related to Tax Matters, Including Changes in Tax Rates or Tax Rules.

As a global company, Moody’s is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is determined based on the taxable income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Moody’s future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors, including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where Moody’s faces higher tax rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which Moody’s is not able to realize the related tax benefit, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, policies and administrative practices, or changes to their interpretation or enforcement, including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting and the global minimum tax rate initiatives being led by the OECD, which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, and the EU’s state aid rulings, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.

In addition, Moody’s is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities around the world. Moody’s regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the Company. Although the Company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its income tax provisions, accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.

During 2023, multiple foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates have enacted legislation to adopt a minimum tax rate described in the GloBE or Pillar II, tax model rules issued by the OECD. A minimum ETR of 15% would apply to multinational companies with consolidated revenue above €750 million with an effective date beginning in 2024. Under the GloBE rules, a company would be required to determine a combined ETR for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional tax rate is less than 15%, an additional tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. While the Pillar II minimum tax requirement is not currently anticipated to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position, management is evaluating and will continue to monitor the potential impact of the Pillar II global minimum tax proposals on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

B. Risks Related to our Business 

The Company is Exposed to Legal, Economic, Operational and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Multiple Jurisdictions.

Moody’s conducts operations in various countries outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources. Changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the Company operates have an impact on the Company’s business. For example, economic uncertainty in the Eurozone or elsewhere, including, but not limited to, in Latin America, China or the Middle East, affects the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. In addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, operations abroad expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:

–economic and geopolitical events and market conditions, such as the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the military conflict in the Middle East, including the effect of these events and conditions on customers, customer retention and demands for our products and services;

–fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads, and exposure to exchange rate movements between foreign currencies and USD;

–restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into USD and the costs, including the tax impact, of repatriating cash held by entities outside the U.S.;

–U.S. laws affecting overseas operations, including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions, such as those related to the U.S.’s relationship with China and embargoes and sanctions laws with respect to Russia, including the Russia-Ukraine military conflict. For example, U.S. economic sanctions have increasingly targeted Chinese persons. In response, China issued a blocking statute that establishes a framework for limiting the effect of foreign sanctions on Chinese persons. Blocking statutes typically create conflicts of law. An entity that is subject to conflicting 

MOODY'S 2024 10-K 27

* * *

Table of Contents

laws in multiple jurisdictions may need to determine a means to comply with such laws. Such conflicts could eventually affect the ability of entities to adhere to applicable laws or continue to operate in certain jurisdictions;

–differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards;

–current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on CRAs hired by issuers of securities;

–uncertain, evolving and new laws and regulations, including those applicable to the financial services industries, such as the EU’s implementation of DORA in January 2025, and to the protection of intellectual property and to the emergence of LLMs in the context of Gen AI and other technologies, such as the EU AI Act, including the effect of these laws and regulations on our customers and on the products and services that we offer;

–uncertainty regarding the future relationship and increasing tensions between the U.S. and China, which may result in further restrictions or actions by the U.S. government with respect to doing business in China and/or by the Chinese government with respect to business conducted by foreign entities in China;

–the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;

–competition with CRAs that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;

–uncertainties in obtaining reliable data and creating products and services relevant to particular geographic markets;

–reduced protection for intellectual property rights;

–longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables;

–differing accounting principles and standards;

–difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

–difficulties and delays in translating documentation into foreign languages; 

–potentially adverse tax consequences; and 

–complexities of compliance with employment laws, various proposed and enacted data privacy laws, and cybersecurity rules in numerous jurisdictions.

Additionally, Moody’s is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, and anti-corruption including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other similar local laws. The internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices the Company has implemented may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination or allegations, even if unfounded, that the Company has violated sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Operations are Exposed to Risks from Infrastructure Malfunctions or Failures.

Moody’s ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which Moody’s is located, including: (i) New York City, the location of Moody’s headquarters, (ii) major cities worldwide in which Moody’s has offices, and (iii) locations that may be affected by the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the military conflict in the Middle East. This may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure (whether or not controlled by the Company), including the Company’s electronic delivery systems, the Company's data center facilities, or the Internet, used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody’s conducts business. Many of the Company’s products and services are delivered electronically and the Company’s customers depend on the Company’s ability to receive, store, process, transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. Some of Moody’s operations require complex processes and the Company’s extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations cannot eliminate such risk completely. To the extent the Company grows through acquisitions, newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technological infrastructure and disaster recovery to the same extent as Moody's has. As their systems are integrated into Moody's, a vulnerability could be introduced, which could impact platforms across the Company. The Company’s customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of the Company’s telecommunications, data centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including its websites and connections to the Internet. The Company’s employees also depend on these systems for internal use. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach, interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the Company’s infrastructure, whether due to human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, weather (including climate-related risks), natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins,

sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, pandemic, war or otherwise, may impair the Company’s ability to deliver its products and services.

Moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. The Company also relies on third-party providers, including, increasingly, cloud-based service providers, to provide certain essential services. While the Company believes that such providers are generally reliable, the Company has limited control over the performance of such providers. To the extent any of the Company’s third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the Company’s needs and the needs of the Company’s customers, the Company could experience lower revenues and higher costs. Additionally, refer to the risk factor entitled “The Company Is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, Cloud and Network Infrastructure (Together, the “Third-Party Technology”), and Any Reduction in Third-Party Product Quality or Service Offerings, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations.”

Additionally, although the Company maintains processes to prevent, detect and recover from a disruption, the Company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with Moody’s customers will suffer. The Company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the Company’s failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to Moody’s operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.

The Economics of the Company’s Business is Dependent on the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets. Recent Financial Market Conditions, Including Decreased Asset Levels and Flows into Investment Vehicles, Increases in Interest Rates and Other Volatility Has Had, and May Continue to Have, a Material Adverse Impact on the Volume of Debt Securities Issued.

Moody’s business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in world financial markets. Furthermore, issuers of debt securities have increasingly elected to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional CRAs, such as MIS. Companies are also increasingly accessing alternative sources of financing, such as loans and debt financing from non-bank lenders that do not involve a CRA-issued credit rating. A majority of Moody’s credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Conditions that reduce issuers’ ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as interest rate and market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations, changes in laws (including tax-related laws) or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which MIS provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees Moody’s earns in its ratings business.

Current market, economic and government factors could negatively impact the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings, which is materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. These factors include increases in or uncertainty around interest rates (as well as related monetary policy by governments in the response to factors such as inflation, inflationary pressures, increases or volatility in mortgage rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments (including the change in the U.S. Presidential administration and uncertainty in various jurisdictions where Moody's operates), difficult economic conditions, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Further declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.

Moody’s initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient. Cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance, compensation and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, cost-reduction initiatives, including those under-taken to date, could make it difficult for the Company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. Further volatility in the financial markets, including decreases in the volumes of debt securities, increases in interest rates, and fluctuations in credit spreads, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition, which the Company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions.

The Introduction of Competing Products, Technologies or Services by Other Companies Can Negatively Impact the Nature and Economics of the Company’s Business.

The markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, business intelligence and analytical services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, including change based on our Gen AI offerings, disruption by the Gen AI offerings of others, changes in customer and investor demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, industry standards and market preferences. The ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products, technologies and services that anticipate customers’ and investors’ changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and cost-effective manner is a key factor in maintaining a competitive market position. Moody’s competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be more agile and better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services, including services based on Gen AI, for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by Moody’s. The increased presence of Gen AI in the market could also lead to increased expectations from customers and market participants that higher quality information will be delivered on advanced timelines. Moody’s also

competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers, some of whom are also suppliers to Moody’s; these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with Moody’s, cease doing business with Moody’s or change the terms under which they do business with Moody’s in a way that could negatively impact our business. In addition, customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing risk, including credit and climate risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and services and its growth prospects. Further, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive information, online and through the use of Gen AI, may reduce the demand for Moody’s products and services. Moody’s growth prospects and operating margins also could be adversely affected by Moody’s failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. Any inability of Moody’s to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Faces Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers.

There is price competition in the credit rating, research, and credit risk management segments, as well as in the segment for research, business intelligence and analytical services offered by MA. Moody’s faces competition globally from other CRAs and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research, as well as from in-house research operations. Competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-NRSROs that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. In addition, the emergence of Gen AI and other technologies may further intensify these pressures, as the Company's competitors may use these tools to deliver solutions at lower prices, or these tools may be used in a way that significantly increases access to publicly available information. At the same time, a challenging business environment and consolidation among both competitors and customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products and commercial real estate, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the Company’s customer base. Recent weak economic growth has intensified competitive pricing pressures, which may result in customers’ use of free or lower-cost information that is increasingly becoming available from alternative sources or their development of alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from Moody’s. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it can lose market share when its pricing is not sufficiently competitive. In addition, the Reform Act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. The formation of additional NRSROs may increase pricing and competitive pressures. Furthermore, in some of the countries in which Moody’s operates, governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies. Any inability of Moody’s to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services will have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Is Exposed to Reputation and Credibility Concerns.

Moody’s reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. To the extent that the credit rating business as a whole or Moody's, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business will be significantly impacted. Factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of conflicts of interest, the performance of securities relative to the ratings assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings and rating methodologies, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process, or the Company’s recent sustainability strategies and our incorporation of climate- and other sustainability-related risks in the Company's rating process, and intentional, poor representation of our products and services by our partners or agents, manipulation of our products and services by third parties, or unintentional misrepresentations of Moody’s products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications. Operational errors, including calculation or methodological errors, or errors in software or data, whether by Moody’s or a Moody’s competitor, could also harm the reputation of the Company or the industries in which the Company operates. Additionally, as Moody's develops its Gen AI product offerings, the Company may incur risks or challenges in its adoption, such as falling behind market expectations for the performance and cost savings related to these offerings, as well as for Moody's perceived expertise regarding these offerings, that could lead to reputational harm. Damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition, as well as on the Company’s ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition.

Our reputation or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and our reporting of such matters

Over the past several years, both in the United States and internationally, regulators, certain investors and other stakeholders have focused on various environmental, social policy, human rights, and other sustainability matters. We communicate certain sustainability initiatives, goals and commitments (including with respect to environmental matters, social matters and other matters), in our various public disclosures, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC and elsewhere. These goals or commitments could be challenging to achieve and costly to implement, and could result in scrutiny, criticism or claims from certain stakeholders, including governmental authorities, regulators, shareholders and customers that could negatively impact our business or reputation. Furthermore, MIS incorporates climate and other sustainability-related risks in its rating process, which also could cause reputational risk or could lead to litigation. The Company could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our net zero 2040 commitment or other sustainability-related initiatives, goals or commitments. Furthermore, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals or commitments, or for any changes to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about such sustainability matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, sufficiency or completeness of such disclosures. We could be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions regarding the accuracy, sufficiency or completeness of our sustainability-related

disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our sustainability-related initiatives, goals or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.

Moody’s Is Exposed to Risks Related to Loss of Skilled Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures.

Moody’s success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced professionals, including financial analysts, data scientists and software engineers. Competition for skilled individuals in the financial services and technology industries is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries. Rising expenses including wage inflation, and global labor shortages could adversely affect Moody’s ability to attract and retain high-quality employees. As greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, Moody’s may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. We could also fail to effectively respond to evolving perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire, including with respect to flexible or remote working arrangements or other matters. Also, the emergence and adoption Gen AI technologies has required and will continue to require upskilling and additional training of Moody's employees, making retention and training increasingly important. There is a risk that even when the Company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed. Further, employee expectations in areas such as ESG have been evolving. A failure to adequately meet employee expectations may result in an inability to attract and retain talented employees.

Moody’s is highly dependent on the continued services of Robert Fauber, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and other senior officers and key employees. The loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and Moody’s inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Moody’s Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Strategic Transactions or Investments May Not Produce Anticipated Results Exposing the Company to Future Significant Impairment Charges Relating to Its Goodwill, Intangible Assets or Property and Equipment.

Moody’s regularly evaluates and enters into acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions and investments to strengthen its business and grow the Company. Such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks. The Company faces intense competition for acquisition targets, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect Moody’s ability to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, the Company makes significant investments in technology, including software for internal use, which can be expensive, time-intensive and complex to develop and implement. 

The anticipated growth, synergies and other strategic objectives of completed transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Any strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies and new employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the Company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets; diversion of management’s focus from other business operations; failure to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; disputes or litigation arising out of acquisitions or dispositions; challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; coordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions; integration of employees from the acquired business into Moody’s organization; integration of the acquired business’s accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative systems with Moody’s; risks that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity risks; and for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. The anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction or investment may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. As a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions and investments to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

At December 31, 2024, Moody’s had $5,994 million of goodwill and $1,890 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. Approximately 94% of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the MA business and are allocated to the two reporting units within MA. The remaining 6% of goodwill and intangible assets reside in MIS and primarily relate to ICRA. Failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. In addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. An asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

Our business could be negatively impacted by climate change.

As a global company, our employees and offices are subject to risks related to the impact of climate change. We have offices in locations that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme weather. In addition, continued reliable energy sources are critical for business continuity globally and those sources too can be impacted by extreme weather. The frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure has the potential to disrupt the Company’s ongoing operations, as well as the operations of our vendors and customers, and may result in losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.

C. Technology Risks

The Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Protection of Confidential Information.

The Company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information. Such information relates to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the Company’s computer systems and networks, and in those of its third-party vendors. The Company also often has access to MNPI and other confidential information concerning its customers, including public and private companies, sovereigns, and other third parties, and their customers, suppliers or transaction counterparties. Unauthorized disclosure of the foregoing information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information, affecting the trading of their securities, damage their reputations or competitive positions and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us, and potentially expose us to risk of litigation.

The risks the Company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target the Company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt and corporate issuers. The Company and its third-party service providers, including our vendors, regularly experience cyber-attacks and data breaches of varying degrees. Cyber-attacks targeting Moody’s or Moody’s vendors’ technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, malware, hacking, social engineering or "phishing" attacks, deepfake attacks, computer viruses, employee or insider threats, malfeasance, supply chain attacks, physical breaches, vendor email compromise, payment fraud or other cyber-attacks some of which may be carried out by state-sponsored actors, may result in unauthorized access, exfiltration, manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s or such vendors’ web sites or systems, applications, data processing, or disruption of other business operations. Such events may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of material information held by the Company (including information about Moody’s business, employees or customers), as well as other sensitive data, including personally identifiable information, the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. The Company's MNPI concerning customers and clients could be improperly used by authorized or unauthorized parties, including for insider trading. The Company has implemented administrative, technical, and physical measures to detect and prevent unauthorized activity, but such precautions may not be successful.

As the Company has grown and acquired businesses, IT guidelines have been developed and applied within business units or inherited from legacy organizations, which can result in internal differences in the Company's approach to IT standards until acquired entities are integrated. This creates a risk of developing unintended vulnerabilities and could result in additional costs, difficulty meeting new regulatory standards, or failing to meet customer expectations. The Company may be exposed to additional threats as it migrates its data from legacy systems to cloud-based solutions, and increased dependence on third-parties to store cloud-based data subjects the Company to further cyber risks. Further, many of our employees work remotely, which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures and may expose the Company to additional cyber risks.

The Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, disaster plans, and technical defenses. Although Moody’s devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update such systems and processes, measures that Moody’s takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective. Further, Moody’s relies on third-party technical subject matter experts to assist in managing its cyber security risk management processes. While Moody’s employs such third parties to assist in strengthening its cybersecurity defenses, there can be no guarantee that any action taken as advised by such third party will be adequate or sufficient to address the evolving threat landscape. Additionally, any measures that Moody’s takes in connection with such third parties to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material cyber security threats or incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective.

Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated global cyber threats. Gen AI has contributed to an increase in the prevalence and sophistication of cyber threats, expanding the Company's exposure to disruptions. Despite the Company’s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from, and has in the past experienced, security threats and system disruptions. Although past incidents have not had a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Because the methods used for these systems cyberattacks are rapidly changing, the Company or its third-party vendors, despite significant focus and investment, may be unable to anticipate and/or deploy sufficient protections against such incidents. Further, the extent of a particular security incident and the steps needed to investigate may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident, including the extent of the harm and how best to remediate it, is known. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity compliance requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of third-party vendors and service providers. Cybersecurity incidents, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or

confidential data, could cause reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company’s customers’ information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. In addition, disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company’s systems or those of the Company’s third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could lead to reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny. 

Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business, operating results and financial condition.

The Company Is Exposed to Risks Related to Protection of Confidential and Personal Information

To conduct its operations, the Company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act in the U.S., the GDPR in the EU, the GDPR in the U.K., the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law in China and various other international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to Moody’s is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, GDPR greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. Additionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. Further, laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), require among other things, covered companies to provide disclosures to consumers, and affords consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy laws, including the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”), and laws in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Montana, Oregon and Texas, which became effective in 2023 and 2024. Data privacy laws have also been passed in numerous U.S. states, including Iowa, Indiana, Tennessee, Delaware, New Jersey, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Rhode Island that will go into effect over the course of 2024, 2025 and 2026. The effects of non-compliance with the CCPA, CPRA and other similar data privacy laws are significant, and may require the Company to modify its data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements have required or could require in the future, changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, requiring significant management time and attention, and subjecting the Company to negative publicity, as well as remedies that may harm its business, including fines, modified demands or orders, the cessation of existing business practices and exposure to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties.

The Company Is Dependent on the Use of Third-Party Software, Data, Hosted Solutions, Data Centers, Cloud and Network Infrastructure (Together, the “Third-Party Technology”), and Any Reduction in Third-Party Product Quality or Service Offerings, Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations.

Moody’s relies on Third-Party Technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations. The Company depends on the ability of Third-Party Technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, provide sufficient cloud computing capacity to meet demand, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, provide data necessary to develop and maintain its products and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. The Third-Party Technology Moody’s uses can become obsolete or restrictive, incompatible with future versions of the Company’s products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, unavailable or fail to operate effectively, and Moody’s business could be adversely affected when the Company is unable to timely or effectively replace such Third-Party Technology. In addition, certain aspects of the Company’s business rely on a concentrated group of vendors, and a cybersecurity breach or event and/or an error caused by one or more of such vendors could have a significant impact on the Company’s operations, as well as the operations of the Company's customers and other Third-Party Technology. 

The Company also monitors its use of Third-Party Technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. Despite the Company’s efforts, the Company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit Moody’s use in the future, resulting in increased Third-Party Technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. In addition, the Company’s operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for Third-Party Technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to Third-Party Technology are substantial. Some of these third-party suppliers are also Moody’s competitors, increasing the risks noted above. 

In the ordinary course, third-parties, including the Company’s vendors, are subject to various forms of cyber-attacks or security incidents. Vulnerabilities in our vendors' software, system or networks or failure of their safeguards, policies or procedures may cause material interruptions to Moody's or our vendors' websites, applications, or data processing, or could compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the impacted information. Additionally, the Company may be exposed to additional threats as the Company migrates its data from legacy systems to cloud-based solutions, and becomes increasingly dependent on third parties to store cloud-based data subjects. To date, such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to Moody’s business operations, but there can be no guarantee the Company will not experience such an impact in the future.

If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT

Governance

Management

The Company maintains a dedicated internal cybersecurity team that interacts with executive management and its business units to identify, assess, manage, and respond to cybersecurity risks and incidents relating to the Company’s information systems and operations. In addition, this internal cybersecurity team is responsible for managing detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. The internal cybersecurity team is managed by the CISO, who reports to the CAO, who is a member of the executive leadership team. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal cybersecurity team consisted of members located in various countries and time zones across the world. The team has members with experience in governance, risk management and compliance, threat monitoring, threat emulation, penetration testing and cyber incident management. Team members have both individual responsibilities and a team focus, covering areas such as network, endpoint device, and e-mail security engineering as well as operations and threat management, monitoring, and response.

The Cyber Committee, chaired by the CISO, and whose members include the CTSO, CAO and Chief Risk & Resiliency Officer, as well as other members of senior management and the legal team, is responsible for identifying cybersecurity risks and threats, recommending mitigating actions to strengthen cybersecurity resilience, and meeting risk tolerance thresholds established by senior management. The Cyber Committee also validates that the Company has appropriate people, process and technology capabilities to identify, mitigate and report on cybersecurity risks to the executive leadership team and the Board of Directors. The Cyber Committee meets regularly to allow members of the internal cybersecurity team to present concerns and recommendations for decisions on preventing, identifying, mitigating, and remediating risks and threats. To the extent warranted, the Cyber Committee may additionally be convened on an ad hoc basis. The Cyber Committee makes decisions regarding the reporting of cybersecurity concerns to the executive leadership team, who escalate issues to the Board and/or the Audit Committee as necessary. In the case of incidents that arise, the Cyber Committee, under the direction of the Board and/or executive leadership team when appropriate, works to involve all appropriate personnel with the aim of resolving the incident, performing any required remediation/reporting, and taking appropriate steps to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The process that the Cyber Committee follows upon emergence of incidents is documented in the Company’s Incident Response Plan. Additionally, cybersecurity risks and the adequacy of associated mitigations are analyzed by senior leadership as part of the enterprise risk assessments that are reported to and discussed by the Board.

The CISO has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills, gained from over 20 years’ experience working in regulated industries. The CISO holds a number of cybersecurity related certifications, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional and Certified Information Security Manager. In addition to the CISO, the CTSO has been a close partner and advocate for cybersecurity at the Company, and is consulted or informed on all decisions or risks that affect the Company's technology systems and/or implicate cybersecurity. The CAO is responsible for overseeing the cybersecurity team at the executive leadership level. 

Board of Directors and Audit Committee

The Board provides oversight of management’s efforts to assess and manage cybersecurity risks and respond to cybersecurity incidents and threats. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regularly receives reports from management regarding the Company’s financial and compliance risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to internal controls and cybersecurity risks.

The Board receives regular updates from the CISO, CTSO, and CAO regarding matters related to technology and cybersecurity. The Company has protocols, as discussed below, by which certain cybersecurity concerns, incidents and threats are escalated within the Company and, where appropriate, reported in a timely manner to the Board.

Risk Management and Strategy

The objective of the Company's comprehensive cybersecurity program is to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity incidents and threats. The Company's cybersecurity program leverages the NIST Framework and it incorporates training and awareness coupled with ongoing monitoring and assessment. The cybersecurity program is an important part of the Company’s enterprise risk management (ERM), with the head of the Company’s ERM program (the Chief Risk & Resiliency Officer) sitting on the Cyber Committee, and sets forth a process for escalating certain incidents to the Company’s ERM group integrated into the Company’s Incident Response Plan. 

As part of the cybersecurity program, the Company’s cybersecurity environment is monitored by automated tools on an ongoing basis and an internal cybersecurity team that reviews threats, alerts, and incidents. The Company’s Incident Response Plan provides governance and guidance in responding to information security incidents and is tested regularly for calibration against existing and emerging threats. The Incident Response Plan describes the process to be followed by the Cyber Committee in connection with the oversight of the cybersecurity environment and specific events that occur from time to time. The cybersecurity program undergoes periodic internal and external reviews. In addition, the Company's Internal Controls Department performs an independent assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s network of cybersecurity controls in accordance with the NIST Framework. The results of the assessment are periodically shared with the Cyber Committee.

The Company’s cybersecurity environment is also subject to routine vulnerability assessment processes. Internal and external teams, including the Cyber Committee, conduct activities such as penetration testing, red teaming, tabletop exercises and phishing drills. Results are measured and assessed for possible improvements. In addition to these ongoing efforts, the Company has a set

of third-party risk management tools through which it monitors for cybersecurity risks and threats associated with its third-party service providers. The Incident Response Plan includes processes that define how the Company manages and responds to such risks or threats associated with its third-party service providers.

The Company contracts with reputable third parties to conduct annual external assessments of its cybersecurity program and its components. Government agencies and their contracted agents also conduct periodic reviews in certain jurisdictions where the Company operates. Insurance agents, customers and other market participants routinely assess the Company’s security posture relative to their own standards.

Security Policy and Requirements

The Company has an Information Security Policy and Information Security Standards, which, taken together, describe the standards and minimum requirements that are expected of all business and information security personnel to protect the Company’s information and technology assets. The policy provides a framework guided by security principles designed to address the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Company’s information assets in the context of internal, external, deliberate and accidental threats, while supporting the Company’s information creation and sharing needs.

The Company is subject to various privacy laws in the jurisdictions where it operates including CCPA and GDPR, as well as U.S. Federal regulation by the FTC, for certain privacy-related aspects of its business, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company is audited in connection with requirements set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Moody’s Analytics obtains third-party audits in connection with the ISO 27001 certification and SOC 1 and SOC 2 attestation reports, respectively, for certain products. As previously mentioned, the Company also aligns with NIST standards in connection with information security, which it uses to evaluate its cybersecurity readiness and resilience, and is required to make various filings and comply with requirements in certain jurisdictions in which it operates.

The Company’s cybersecurity program also includes an information security training and awareness program called InfoSafe for all employees. The program includes annual certification to having read and understood the Company's IT Use Policy, continuing education on phishing awareness, regular communications about cybersecurity best practices, and participation in annual events like Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Employees are expected to complete annual cybersecurity training, and compliance is monitored. The Company uses general and targeted phishing simulations to help employees better recognize and respond to potential threats. The training program is further enhanced by cybersecurity experts speaking at educational events. The Company also offers specialized training modules on emerging cybersecurity threats for its software development teams. The Company’s IT Use Policy outlines a detailed escalation process under which employees are to immediately report any suspected cybersecurity incident.

The cybersecurity threat landscape is dynamic and volatile, and requires significant investment on the part of the Company in terms of talent recruitment and retention, as well as procuring and deploying the correct tools to address threats. Additional information on cybersecurity risks is discussed in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” under the heading “Technology Risks,” which should be read in conjunction with the foregoing information.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Moody’s Corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains Forward-Looking Statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” commencing on page 61 and Item 1A. “Risk Factors” commencing on page 23 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.

The Company

Moody’s is a global integrated risk assessment firm that empowers organizations to anticipate, adapt and thrive in a new era of exponential risk. Moody’s reports in two segments: MA and MIS. 

MA is a global provider of: i) research and insights; ii) data and information; and iii) decision solutions, which help companies make better and faster decisions. MA leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities. 

MIS publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates

Moody’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires Moody’s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, Moody’s evaluates its critical accounting estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

At July 31st of each year, Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., MA and MIS), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment).

The Company has four reporting units: two reporting units within MA consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and CRE solutions, and two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations).

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired, and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years. 

At July 31, 2024, the Company performed quantitative assessments for each of the four reporting units in accordance with the aforementioned policy. These quantitative assessments resulted in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. 

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are more fully described below. In addition, the Company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.

Other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.

Table of Contents

Methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units:

The following is a discussion regarding the Company’s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding ICRA, as of July 31, 2024. As ICRA is a publicly traded company in India, the Company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization. 

The fair value of each reporting unit, excluding ICRA, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Moody’s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.

The sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and WACC assumptions are described below. These key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology require significant management judgment:

–Future cash flow assumptions \- The projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. These projections are consistent with the Company’s operating budget and strategic plan. Cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. Beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real GDP growth rates. A sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. For each reporting unit analyzed, a 10% reduction in the revenue growth rates used would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.

–WACC \- The WACC is the rate used to discount each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows. The WACC is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate and an equity risk factor, which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit’s cash flows. The cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the Company’s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the WACC. The cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. The WACC for all reporting units ranged from 10.0% to 10.5% as of July 31, 2024. Differences in the WACC used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. A sensitivity analysis of the WACC was performed on all reporting units as of July 31, 2024 for each reporting unit. For all reporting units, an increase in the WACC of one percentage point would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.

Long-lived assets

Long-lived assets, which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets, operating lease ROU Assets and property and equipment, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Under the first step of the recoverability assessment, Moody's compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value, no further assessment is required. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, Moody's proceeds with step two of the assessment. Under step two of this assessment, Moody's is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In performing this assessment, Moody's must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value, including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate. Moody's must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company is subject to tax audits in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for UTPs. The Company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.

For UTPs, ASC Topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-

MOODY'S 2024 10-K 39

Table of Contents

than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. As the determination of liabilities related to UTPs and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.

Contingencies

Accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. In many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. The provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management’s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. The Company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. Moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

In view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

The expenses, assets and liabilities that Moody’s reports for its Retirement Plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These significant assumptions include the following:

–future compensation increases based on the Company’s long-term actual experience and future outlook;

–long-term expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan’s portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and

–discount rates based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.

The discount rates used to measure the present value of the Company’s benefit obligation for its Retirement Plans as of December 31, 2024 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the Company compares each plan’s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the FTSE pension discount curve. The cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.

Moody’s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. In determining these assumptions, the Company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the Company’s Retirement Plans. 

When actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. Excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the Company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. For Moody’s Retirement Plans, the total actuarial losses as of December 31, 2024 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $48 million, and Moody’s expects the net periodic expense related to the amortization of net actuarial (losses)/gains will be immaterial in 2025.

For Moody’s funded U.S. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense. As permitted under ASC Topic 715, the Company amortizes the impact

of asset returns over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets’ component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has an unrecognized loss of $68 million, of which $19 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2025 expense.

The table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on Moody’s 2025 income before provision for income taxes. These effects have been calculated using the Company’s current projections of 2025 expenses, assets and liabilities related to Moody’s Retirement Plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Weighted Average Discount Rates (1)| 5.43%/5.40%| | $| (4)|   
Weighted Average Assumed Compensation Growth Rate| 3.60%| | $| 1 |   
Assumed Long-Term Rate of Return on Pension Assets| 6.60%| | $| (5)|   

(1)Weighted average discount rates of 5.43% and 5.40% for pension plans and Other Retirement Plans, respectively.

Based on current projections, the Company estimates that net periodic expense related to Retirement Plans will be immaterial in 2025.

Investments in Non-consolidated Affiliates

Equity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. These investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary.

For equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the Company does not have significant influence, Moody's generally elects to measure these investments at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place. 

The Company performs an assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment for its investments in non-consolidated affiliates. If there are indicators of impairment, the Company estimates the investment’s fair value and records an impairment if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value.

In situations where estimation of fair value is required for investments in non-consolidated affiliates, the Company considers various factors, including: recent observable investee equity transactions, comparable public company/precedent transaction multiples and discounted cash flow models. The estimation of fair value for these investments may involve significant judgment.

Other Estimates

In addition to the critical accounting estimates described above, there are other accounting estimates within Moody’s consolidated financial statements. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in Moody’s consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact Moody’s.

Reportable Segments

The Company is organized into two reportable segments at December 31, 2024: MA and MIS, which are more fully described in the section entitled “The Company” above and in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Market Risk

FX risk:

Moody’s maintains a presence in more than 40 countries. In 2024, approximately 39% of the Company’s revenue and approximately 38% of the Company's expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally in the British pound and the euro. As such, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in FX rates. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 49% of Moody’s assets were located outside the U.S., making the Company susceptible to fluctuations in FX rates. The effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations with non-U.S. functional currencies to the U.S. dollar are charged or credited to OCI.

The effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are charged to other non-operating income, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency. The following table shows the impact to the fair value of the forward contracts if currencies being purchased were to weaken by 10%:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Foreign Currency Forwards (1)| | Impact on fair value of contract  
Sell| | Buy

(1)Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further detail on the forward contracts.

The change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by FX revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency.

Derivatives and non-derivatives designated as net investment hedges:

The Company designates derivative instruments and foreign currency-denominated debt as hedges of foreign currency risk of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries (net investment hedges) under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. 

Cross-currency swaps

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries, for which the notional values and corresponding interest rates are disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

If the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $321 million unfavorable impact to the fair value of the cross-currency swaps recognized in OCI, which would be offset by favorable currency translation gains on the Company’s euro net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

Euro-denominated debt

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has designated €500 million of the 2015 Senior Notes and €750 million of the 2019 Senior Notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate FX exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. If the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, there would be an approximate $129 million unfavorable adjustment to OCI related to these net investment hedges. This adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the Company’s euro net investment in subsidiaries.

Interest rate and credit risk:

Interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge:

The Company’s interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to a desired risk profile. Moody’s uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed-rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the SOFR. These swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. A hypothetical change of 100 BPS in the SOFR-based swap rate would result in an approximate $161 million change to the fair value of the swaps, which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item.

Additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Moody’s cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the U.S. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Moody's remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by both investing in the Company's employees and growing the business through targeted organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions aligned with strategic priorities. Additional excess capital is returned to the Company’s shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases.

Cash Flow

The Company is currently financing its operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases from operating and financing cash flows.

The following is a summary of the changes in the Company’s cash flows followed by a brief discussion of these changes:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Year Ended December 31,| | $ Change   
Favorable/ (unfavorable)|   
| 2024| | 2023| |   
Net cash provided by operating activities| $| 2,838 | | | $| 2,151 | | | $| 687 | |   
Net cash used in investing activities| $| (1,056)| | | $| (247)| | | $| (809)| |   
Net cash used in financing activities| $| (1,446)| | | $| (1,584)| | | $| 138 | |   
Free Cash Flow (1)| $| 2,521 | | | $| 1,880 | | | $| 641 | |   

(1)Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital additions. Refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of this MD&A for further information on this financial measure.

Net cash provided by operating activities

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by $687 million compared to the prior year, with the most notable drivers reflecting: 

–growth in operating income of $738 million coupled with various changes in working capital;

partially offset by:

–$269 million in higher income tax payments in the current year.

Net cash used in investing activities

The $809 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2023 primarily reflects:

–higher net purchases of investments in 2024 of $535 million;

–higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $218 million primarily due to the acquisition of Numerated in the fourth quarter of 2024, GCR and Praedicat in the third quarter of 2024, and certain other immaterial acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2024; and

–higher cash paid for capital additions of $46 million compared to the prior year reflecting both the development of SaaS-based solutions in MA coupled with costs to support investments in company-wide technology infrastructure.

Net cash used in financing activities

The $138 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributed to:

MOODY'S 2024 10-K 57

Table of Contents

–a $500 million repayment of notes payable in 2023; and

–a $496 million issuance of notes in the third quarter of 2024;

partially offset by:

– higher cash paid for treasury share repurchases in 2024 of $802 million compared to the prior year.

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments

The Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.0 billion at December 31, 2024 included approximately $1.7 billion located outside of the U.S. Approximately 33% of the Company’s aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in EUR and GBP. The Company manages both its U.S. and non-U.S. cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.

As a result of the Tax Act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax since 2017. The Company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the U.S. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, the Company continues to repatriate a portion of its non-U.S. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the Tax Act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the U.S., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes.

Material Cash Requirements

The Company's material cash requirements consist of the following contractual and other obligations:

Financing Arrangements

Indebtedness

At December 31, 2024, Moody’s had $7.4 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $1 billion of additional capacity available under the Company’s CP program, which is backstopped by the $1.25 billion 2024 Credit Facility.

The repayment schedule for the Company’s borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024 is as follows:

Future interest payments and fees associated with the Company's debt and credit facility are expected to be $4.7 billion, of which approximately $300 million is expected to be paid in each of the next five years, and the remaining amount expected to be paid thereafter. For additional information on the Company's outstanding debt, CP program and 2024 Credit Facility, refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which could result in higher financing costs.

Purchase Obligations 

Purchase obligations generally include multi-year agreements with vendors to purchase goods or services and mainly include data center/cloud hosting fees and fees for information technology licensing and maintenance. As of December 31, 2024, these purchase obligations totaled $716 million, of which approximately 45% is expected to be paid in the next twelve months and another approximate 45% expected to be paid over the next two subsequent years, with the remainder to be paid thereafter.

Leases

The Company has remaining payments related to its operating leases of $478 million at December 31, 2024, primarily related to real estate leases, of which $111 million in payments are expected over the next twelve months. For more information on the expected cash flows relating to the Company's operating leases, refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Pension and Other Retirement Plan Obligations

The Company does not anticipate making significant contributions to its funded pension plan in the next twelve months. This plan is overfunded at December 31, 2024, and accordingly holds sufficient investments to fund future benefit obligations. Payments for the

Table of Contents

Company's unfunded plans are not expected to be material in either the short or long-term. For further information on the Company's pension and other retirement plan obligations, refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Dividends and share repurchases

On February 12, 2025, the Board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share for Moody’s common stock, payable March 14, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 2025. The continued payment of dividends at this rate, or at all, is subject to the discretion of the Board.

On February 5, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized $1 billion in share repurchase authority. On October 15, 2024, the Board authorized an additional $1.5 billion in share repurchase authority. At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $1.6 billion of remaining authority under these authorizations. There is no established expiration date for the remaining authorizations.

Restructuring

As more fully discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is currently in the process of executing the Strategic and Operational Efficiency Restructuring Program. Future cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be $165 million to $195 million, which are expected to be paid out through 2027.

Sources of Funding to Satisfy Material Cash Requirements

The Company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2025. Cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the Company’s profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. The Company may also borrow from various sources as described above.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures:

In addition to its reported results, Moody’s has included in this MD&A certain adjusted results that the SEC defines as “Non-GAAP financial measures.” Management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors’ operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These adjusted measures, as defined by the Company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. Furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other GAAP measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the Company. Below are brief descriptions of the Company’s adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:

The Company presents Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody's operating performance. Adjusted Operating Income excludes the impact of: i) depreciation and amortization; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; and iii) charges related to asset abandonment. Depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different useful lives and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. Restructuring charges/adjustments and charges related to asset abandonment, which the Company believes are not reflective of its ongoing operating cost structure, are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies. Refer to Notes 9 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the nature of the Company’s restructuring programs and asset abandonment, respectively.

Management believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the Company’s operating results from period to period and across companies. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Margin as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenue.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS attributable to Moody’s common shareholders:

The Company presents Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on Moody's operating performance. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS exclude the impact of: i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; iii) charges related to asset abandonment; and iv) gains on previously held equity method investments.

The Company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different estimated useful lives and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. These intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation. The amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. Restructuring charges/adjustments and charges related to asset abandonment, which the Company believes are not reflective of its ongoing operating cost structure, and gains on previously held equity method investments are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies. 

The Company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted EPS from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.

Free Cash Flow:

The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital additions. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is a useful metric in assessing the Company’s cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Management deems capital expenditures essential to the Company’s product and service innovations and maintenance of Moody’s operational capabilities. Accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of Moody’s cash flow.

Key Performance Metrics:

The Company presents ARR on a constant currency organic basis for its MA business as a supplemental performance metric to provide additional insight on the estimated value of MA's recurring revenue contracts at a given point in time. The Company uses ARR to manage and monitor performance of its MA operating segment and believes that this metric is a key indicator of the trajectory of MA's recurring revenue base.

The Company calculates ARR by taking the total recurring contract value for each active renewable contract as of the reporting date, divided by the number of days in the contract and multiplied by 365 days to create an annualized value. The Company defines renewable contracts as subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and renewable services. ARR excludes transaction sales including one-time training, services and perpetual licenses. In order to compare period-over-period ARR excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the Company bases the calculation on currency rates utilized in its current year operating budget and holds these FX rates constant for the duration of all current and prior periods being reported. Additionally, ARR excludes contracts related to acquisitions to provide additional perspective in assessing growth excluding the impacts from certain acquisition activity.

The Company’s definition of ARR may differ from definitions utilized by other companies reporting similarly named measures, and this metric should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Moody’s Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Moody’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Moody’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company evaluated and assessed the design and operational effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Based on the assessment performed, management has concluded that Moody’s maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Moody's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors

Moody’s Corporation:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Moody's Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Gross uncertain tax positions

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded uncertain tax positions (UTPs), excluding associated interest of $211 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. We identified the assessment of the Company’s gross UTPs as a critical audit matter because complex judgment was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of the tax positions.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s tax process, including those related to the timely identification of UTPs, the assessment of new information related to previously identified UTPs, and the measurement of UTPs. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws and judgments about the administrative practices of tax authorities

•inspecting settlement documents with applicable taxing authorities

•assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations

•performing an assessment of the Company’s tax positions and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment. 

In addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its gross UTPs by comparing historical gross UTPs to actual results upon conclusion of tax audits or expiration of the statute of limitations.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.

MOODY’S CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(tabular dollar and share amounts in millions, except per share data)

NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Moody’s is a global provider of integrated perspectives on risk that empowers organizations and investors to make better decisions. Moody’s reports in two reportable segments: MA and MIS.

MA is a global provider of: i) data and information; ii) research and insights; and iii) decision solutions, which help companies make better and faster decisions. MA leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities.

MIS publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities. 

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2024

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" ("ASU No. 2023-07"), which expands segment disclosure requirements for public entities. ASU No. 2023-07 requires entities to disclose significant segment expenses by reportable segment if they are regularly provided to the CODM and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. In addition, this ASU permits entities to disclose more than one measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM. Additionally, disclosure of the CODM’s title and position will be required on an annual basis, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s). Furthermore, all existing annual disclosures about segment profit or loss and assets must be provided on an interim basis in addition to disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this ASU retrospectively for all periods presented with the new required disclosures presented in Note 20.

Reclassification of Previously Reported Revenue by LOB

In the first quarter of 2024, pursuant to the integration of RMS into the Company's order-to-cash systems, the Company reclassified certain prior year revenue by geography disclosures. The impact of the reclassification was not material, and prior year revenue by LOB disclosures have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation, which is disclosed in Note 3.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include those of Moody’s Corporation and its majority- and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The effects of all intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies for which the Company has significant influence over operating and financial policies but not a controlling interest are accounted for on an equity basis whereby the Company records its proportional share of the investment’s net income or loss as part of other non-operating income (expense), net and any dividends received reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the Company does not have significant influence are accounted for under the ASC Topic 321 measurement alternative; these investments are recorded at initial cost, less impairment, adjusted upward or downward for any observable price changes in similar investments. The Company applies the guidelines set forth in ASC Topic 810 assessing its interests in voting and variable interest entities to decide whether to consolidate an entity. The Company has reviewed the potential variable interest entities and determined that there are no consolidation requirements under ASC Topic 810. The Company consolidates its ICRA subsidiaries on a three month lag.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash equivalents principally consist of investments in money market deposit accounts and money market funds as well as certificates of deposit with maturities of three months or less when purchased.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments are securities with maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase that are available for operations in the next 12 months. The Company’s short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit and their cost approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. Interest and dividends on these investments are recorded into income when earned.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not extend the economic useful life of the related assets are charged to expense as incurred.

Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

The Company capitalizes costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use. These assets, included in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets, relate to MA's SaaS-based solutions as well as the Company’s financial, website and other systems. Such costs generally consist of employee compensation, direct costs for third-party license fees and professional services provided by third parties, in each case incurred either during the application development stage or in connection with upgrades and enhancements that increase functionality. Such costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of development as well as maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

The Company also capitalizes implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements (e.g., hosted arrangements) and depreciates the costs over the non-cancellable term of the cloud computing arrangements plus any option renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised or for which the exercise is controlled by the service provider. The Company classifies the amortization of capitalized implementation costs in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as the fees associated with the hosting service (i.e., operating and SG&A expense) and classifies the related payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting service (i.e. cash flows from operating activities). In addition, the capitalization of implementation costs is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets consistent with the location of prepayment of fees for the hosting element (i.e., within other current assets or other assets).

Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

Moody’s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., MA and MIS), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment), annually as of July 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with ASC Topic 350.

The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. In the first step, the Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. If a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the Company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform further testing. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. 

The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the Company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. For the reporting units where the Company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the Company’s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years.

For purposes of assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company has four reporting units: two reporting units within MA consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and CRE solutions and two within the Company’s ratings business (one for the ICRA business and one that encompasses all of Moody’s other ratings operations).

Impairment of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets

Long-lived assets (including ROU Assets) and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

Under the first step of the recoverability assessment, the Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to their carrying value. If the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value, no further assessment is required. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, Moody's proceeds with step two of the assessment. Under step two of this assessment, Moody's is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group (reduced by the estimated cost to sell the asset for assets or disposal groups classified as held-for-sale) and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense over the requisite service period for all share-based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant. This includes shares issued under stock option and restricted stock plans.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Based on the Company’s risk management policy, the Company may use derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values on a gross basis. The changes in the value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the same income statement line item in earnings in which the corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item is presented. The entire change in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded to OCI and such amounts are reclassified from AOCI(L) to the same income statement line in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income. The Company assesses effectiveness for net investment hedges using the spot-method. The entire change in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as net investment hedges is initially recorded to OCI. Those changes in fair value attributable to components included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in a net investment hedge are recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of OCI and remain in AOCI(L) until the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Those changes in fair value attributable to components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in a net investment hedge are recorded to OCI and amortized to earnings using a systematic and rational method over the duration of the hedge. Any changes in the fair value of derivatives that the Company does not designate as hedging instruments under ASC Topic 815 are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of cash flows in a manner consistent with the recognition of the underlying hedged item.

Revenue Recognition and Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer

Revenue recognition:

Revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.

When contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation on a relative SSP basis. The Company determines the SSP by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately or uses management’s best estimate of SSP for goods or services not sold separately using estimation techniques that maximize observable data points, including: internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives; standalone sales prices of similar products; pricing policies; percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service; and geography.

Sales, usage-based, value added and other taxes are excluded from revenues.

MA Revenue

In the MA segment, products and services offered by the Company include hosted research and data subscriptions, installed and hosted software subscriptions, perpetual installed software licenses and related maintenance, or PCS, and professional services. Subscription and PCS contracts are generally invoiced in advance of the contractual coverage period, which is principally one year, but can range from 3-5 years. Professional services are invoiced as those services are provided. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, but primarily include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.

Revenue from research, data and other hosted subscriptions is recognized ratably over the related subscription period as MA's performance obligation to provide access to these products is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract. A large portion of these services are invoiced in the months of November, December and January.

Revenue from installed software subscriptions, which includes PCS, is bifurcated into a software license performance obligation and a PCS performance obligation, which follow the patterns of recognition described above, except for those installed subscriptions where the software license and PCS performance obligations were determined to be incapable of being distinct from each other in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-19 and ASC 606-10-25-20. In such instances, revenue is recognized over time. Revenue from the sale of a software license, when considered distinct from the related software implementation services, is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to the customer. PCS is generally recognized ratably over the contractual period commencing when the software license is fully delivered.

For implementation services and other service projects for which fees are fixed, the Company determined progress towards completion is most accurately measured on a percentage-of-completion basis (input method) as this approach utilizes the most directly observable data points and is therefore used to recognize the related revenue. For implementation services where price varies based on time expended, a time-based measure of progress towards completion of the performance obligation is utilized.

Revenue from professional services rendered is generally recognized over time as the services are performed.

Products and services offered within the MA segment are sold either stand-alone or together in various combinations. In instances where an arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for the individual performance obligations separately if they are considered distinct. Revenue is generally allocated to all performance obligations based upon the relative SSP at contract inception. For certain performance obligations, judgment is required to determine the SSP. Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above.

In the MA segment, customers usually pay a fixed fee for the products and services based on signed contracts. However, accounting for variable consideration is applied mainly for: i) estimates for cancellation rights and price concessions and ii) T&M based services.

76 MOODY'S 2024 10-K

Table of Contents

The Company estimates the variable consideration associated with cancellation rights and price concessions based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduces the amount of revenue to be recognized.

MIS Revenue

In the MIS segment, revenue arrangements with multiple elements are generally comprised of two distinct performance obligations, a rating and the related monitoring service. Revenue attributed to ratings of issued securities is generally recognized when the rating is delivered to the issuer. Revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed, generally one year. In the case of certain structured finance products, primarily CMBS, issuers can elect to pay all of the annual monitoring fees upfront. These fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities.

MIS arrangements generally have standard contractual terms for which the stated payments are due at conclusion of the ratings process for ratings and either upfront or in arrears for monitoring services; and are signed by customers either on a per issue basis or at the beginning of the relationship with the customer. In situations when customer fees for an arrangement may be variable, the Company estimates the variable consideration at inception using the expected value method based on analysis of similar contracts in the same line of business, which is constrained based on the Company’s assessment of the realization of the adjustment amount.

The Company allocates the transaction price within arrangements that include multiple performance obligations based upon the relative SSP of each service. The SSP for both rating and monitoring services is generally based upon observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately to similar customers.

Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract with a Customer:

Costs to obtain a contract with a customer

Costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the Company expects to recover those costs. These costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of the products or services to the customer. Depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals. Determining the estimated economic life of the products sold requires judgment with respect to anticipated future technological changes. Costs to obtain customer contracts are only incurred in the MA segment.

Cost to fulfill a contract with a customer

Costs incurred to fulfill customer contracts, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs relate directly to a contract, generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and the Company expects to recover those costs.

The Company capitalizes royalty costs within the MA segment related to third-party information data providers associated with hosted company information and business intelligence products. These costs are amortized to expense consistent with the recognition pattern of the related revenue over time.

In addition, the Company capitalizes work-in-process costs for in-progress MIS ratings, which is recognized consistent with the rendering of the related services to the customers, as ratings are issued.

Accounts Receivable Allowances 

In order to determine an estimate of expected credit losses, receivables are segmented based on similar risk characteristics including historical credit loss patterns to calculate reserve rates. The Company uses an aging method for developing its allowance for credit losses by which receivable balances are stratified based on aging category. A reserve rate is calculated for each aging category which is generally based on historical information, and is adjusted, when necessary, for current conditions (e.g., macroeconomic or industry related) and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. The Company also considers customer specific information (e.g., bankruptcy or financial difficulty) when estimating its expected credit losses, as well as the economic environment of the customers, both from an industry and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for allowances. Expected credit losses are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance. Actual uncollectible account write-offs are recorded against the allowance.

Leases

The Company has operating leases, which substantially all relate to the lease of office space. The Company’s leases which are classified as finance leases are not material to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company determines if an arrangement meets the definition of a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes in its consolidated balance sheets a lease liability and an ROU Asset for all leases with a lease term greater than 12 months. In determining the length of the lease term, the Company utilizes judgment in assessing the likelihood of whether it is reasonably certain that it will exercise an option to extend or early-terminate a lease, if such options are provided in the lease agreement.

ROU Assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU Assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease 

MOODY'S 2024 10-K 77

Table of Contents

commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As substantially all of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rates at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. These secured incremental borrowing rates are attributable to the currency in which the lease is denominated.

At commencement, the Company’s initial measurement of the ROU Asset is calculated as the present value of the remaining lease payments (i.e., lease liability), with additive adjustments reflecting: initial direct costs (e.g., broker commissions) and prepaid lease payments (if any); and reduced by any lease incentives provided by the lessor if: (i) received before lease commencement or (ii) receipt of the lease incentive is contingent upon future events for which the occurrence is both probable and within the Company’s control.

Lease expense for minimum operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This straight-line lease expense represents a single lease cost which is comprised of both an interest accretion component relating to the lease liability and amortization of the ROU Assets. The Company records this single lease cost in operating and SG&A expenses. However, in situations where an operating lease ROU Asset has been impaired, the subsequent amortization of the ROU Asset is then recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and is combined with accretion expense on the lease liability to result in single operating lease cost (which subsequent to impairment will no longer follow a straight-line recognition pattern).

The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components. For the Company’s office space leases, the lease components (e.g., fixed rent payments) and non-lease components (e.g., fixed common-area maintenance costs) are combined and accounted for as a single lease component.

Variable lease payments (e.g., variable common-area-maintenance costs) are only included in the initial measurement of the lease liability to the extent those payments depend on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments not included in the lease liability are recognized in net income in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.

Contingencies

Moody’s is involved in legal and tax proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation that are incidental to the Company’s business, including claims based on ratings assigned by MIS. Moody’s is also subject to ongoing tax audits in the normal course of business. Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. Moody’s discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. Moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

In view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.

Operating Expenses

Operating expenses include costs associated with the development and production of the Company’s products and services and their delivery to customers. These expenses principally include employee compensation and benefits and travel costs that are incurred in connection with these activities. Operating expenses are charged to income as incurred.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses include such items as compensation and benefits for corporate officers and staff and compensation and other expenses related to sales. They also include items such as office rent, business insurance and professional fees. SG&A expenses are charged to income as incurred.

Foreign Currency Translation

For all operations outside the U.S. where the Company has designated the local currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of year exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated using

average exchange rates for the year. For these foreign operations, currency translation adjustments are recorded to other comprehensive income.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources including: foreign currency translation impacts; net actuarial gains and losses and net prior service costs related to pension and other retirement plans; and gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges or cash flow hedges. Comprehensive income items, including cumulative translation adjustments of entities that are less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries, will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests and thereby, adjusting AOCI(L) proportionately in accordance with the percentage of ownership interest of the non-controlling shareholder. Additionally, the Company reclassifies the income tax effects from AOCI(L) at such time as the earnings or loss of the related activity are recognized in earnings.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.

The Company classifies interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties are recognized in other non-operating expenses. For UTPs, the Company first determines whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.

The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and certain short-term investments consisting primarily of certificates of deposit and money market deposits, all of which are short-term in nature and, accordingly, approximate fair value.

The Company also invests in mutual funds, which are accounted for as equity securities with readily determinable fair values under ASC Topic 321. The Company measures these investments at fair value with both realized gains and losses and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments included in net income.

Also, the Company uses derivative instruments to manage certain financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Fair value is defined by the ASC Topic 820 as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The determination of this fair value is based on the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company could commence transactions and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. Also, determination of fair value assumes that market participants will consider the highest and best use of the asset.

The ASC establishes a fair value hierarchy whereby the inputs contained in valuation techniques used to measure fair value are categorized into three broad levels as follows:

Level 1: quoted market prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the date of the fair value measurement;

Level 2: inputs other than quoted market prices described in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities;

Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value measurement of the assets or liabilities.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables and derivatives.

For cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivatives, the Company manages its credit exposure by limiting the amount of counterparty risk with any particular financial institution; limits are assigned to each counterparty based on perceived quality of credit and are monitored daily. Cash equivalents are held among various money market deposit accounts, money market funds, and certificates of deposits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of

deposit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Derivatives primarily consist of foreign exchange forwards or swap contracts (interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. For trade receivables, no customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Earnings per Share of Common Stock

Basic shares outstanding is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares, assuming that such shares were outstanding and dilutive during the reporting period.

Pension and Other Retirement Benefits

Moody’s maintains various noncontributory DBPPs as well as other contributory and noncontributory retirement plans. The expense and assets/liabilities that the Company reports for its pension and other retirement benefits are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimates and may vary by plan. The differences between the assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and actual experience is spread over a five-year period to the market-related value of plan assets, which is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual pension expense. All other actuarial gains and losses are generally deferred and amortized over the estimated average future working life of active plan participants.

The Company recognizes as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheet the funded status of its defined benefit retirement plans, measured on a plan-by-plan basis. Changes in the funded status due to actuarial gains/losses are recorded as part of other comprehensive income during the period the changes occur.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" ("ASU No. 2023-09"), which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU No. 2023-09 require entities to disclose additional income tax information, primarily related to greater disaggregation of the entity's ETR reconciliation and income taxes paid by jurisdiction disclosures. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses" ("ASU No. 2024-03"). The amendments in this ASU require more detailed disclosures about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements (including employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization) and apply to both interim and annual reporting periods. ASU No. 2024-03 also requires disclosure of total selling expenses for both interim and annual reporting periods, with an additional requirement to provide an entity’s definition of selling expenses in annual reporting. This ASU is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied either (1) prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after the aforementioned effective dates or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Unbilled Receivables, Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations

Unbilled receivables

For certain MA arrangements, the timing of when the Company has the unconditional right to consideration and recognizes revenue occurs prior to invoicing the customer. In addition, certain MIS arrangements contain contractual terms whereby the customers are billed in arrears for annual monitoring services, requiring revenue to be accrued as an unbilled receivable as such services are provided. 

The following table presents the Company's unbilled receivables, which are included within accounts receivable, net, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Unbilled Receivables| $| 122 | | | $| 426 | | | $| 119 | | | $| 415 |   

Deferred revenue

The Company recognizes deferred revenue when a contract requires a customer to pay consideration to the Company in advance of when revenue related to that contract is recognized. This deferred revenue is relieved when the Company satisfies the related performance obligation and revenue is recognized.

Significant changes in the deferred revenue balances during the year ended December 31, 2024 are as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

For the MA segment, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to organic growth. The change in deferred revenue for both segments was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Remaining performance obligations

Remaining performance obligations in the MA segment include both amounts recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 as well as amounts not yet invoiced to customers as of December 31, 2024, largely reflecting future revenue related to signed multi-year arrangements for hosted and installed subscription-based products. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $4.4 billion. The Company expects to recognize into revenue approximately 55% of this balance within one year, approximately 25% of this balance between one to two years and the remaining amount thereafter.

Remaining performance obligations in the MIS segment largely reflect deferred revenue related to monitoring fees for certain structured finance products, primarily CMBS, where the issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees for the life of the security in advance. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately $102 million. The Company expects to recognize into revenue approximately 25% of this balance within one year, approximately 50% of this balance between one to five years and the remaining amount thereafter. With respect to the remaining performance obligations for the MIS segment, the Company has applied a practical expedient set forth in ASC Topic 606 permitting the omission of unsatisfied performance obligations relating to contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.

NOTE 6 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Accordingly, the Company uses derivatives in certain instances to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes.

Derivatives and non-derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:

Fair Value Hedges

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the SOFR. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the risk associated with changes in the fair value of the long-term debt, thus the Company has designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The fair value of the swaps is adjusted quarterly with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the debt. The changes in the fair value of the swaps and the underlying hedged item generally offset and the net cash settlements on the swaps are recorded each period within interest expense, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

The following table summarizes the Company’s interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

NOTE 9 RESTRUCTURING 

On December 19, 2024, the CEO of Moody’s approved the Strategic and Operational Efficiency Restructuring Program. The Company estimates that upon completion, the program will result in annualized savings of $250 million to $300 million. This program relates to the Company's strategy to realign its operations toward high priority growth areas and to consolidate certain functions to simplify the organization to enable improved operating efficiency and leverage. This program will primarily include a reduction in staff, the rationalization and exit of certain leased office spaces and the retirement of certain legacy software applications. The program includes $170 million to $200 million of expected pre-tax personnel-related restructuring charges, an amount that includes severance costs, expense related to the modification of equity awards and other related costs primarily determined under the Company’s existing severance plans. In addition, the program is expected to result in $10 million to $20 million of non-cash charges from the exit from certain leased office spaces and $20 million to $30 million of non-cash charges related to incremental amortization of internally developed software due to a reduction in the useful life of the software assets. The savings generated from the Strategic and Operational Efficiency Restructuring Program are expected to strengthen the Company's operating margin, with a portion being deployed to support strategic investments. The Strategic and Operational Efficiency Restructuring Program is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2026. Cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be $170 million to $200 million, which are expected to be paid through 2027.

(1)Represents fair value of certain derivative contracts as more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

The following are descriptions of the methodologies utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of its derivative contracts, money market mutual funds and mutual funds:

Derivatives:

In determining the fair value of the derivative contracts in the tables above, the Company utilizes industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using spot rates, forward points, currency volatilities, interest rates as well as the risk of non-performance of the Company and the counterparties with whom it has derivative contracts. The Company established strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enters into transactions with financial institutions that adhere to these guidelines. Accordingly, the risk of counterparty default is deemed to be minimal.

Money market funds and mutual funds:

The money market funds and mutual funds in the tables above are deemed to be equity securities with readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recognized through net income under ASC Topic 321. The fair value of these instruments is determined using Level 1 inputs as defined in the ASC Topic 820.

NOTE 13 PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS

U.S. Plans

Moody’s maintains funded and unfunded noncontributory DBPPs. The DBPPs provide defined benefits using a cash balance formula based on years of service and career average salary or final average pay for selected executives. The Company also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees. The retirement healthcare plans are contributory; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. Moody’s funded and unfunded U.S. pension plans, the U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Retirement Plans.” The U.S. retirement healthcare plans and the U.S. retirement life insurance plans are collectively referred to herein as the “Other Retirement Plans.”

Through 2007, substantially all U.S. employees were eligible to participate in the Company’s DBPPs. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company no longer offers DBPPs to U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2008, and new hires in the U.S. instead will receive a retirement contribution in similar benefit value under the Company’s Profit Participation Plan. Current participants of the Company’s Retirement Plans and Other Retirement Plans continue to accrue benefits based on existing plan benefit formulas.

The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the Company’s best estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and is determined by using a building block approach, which generally weighs the underlying long-term expected rate of return for each major asset class based on their respective allocation target within the plan portfolio, net of plan paid expenses. As the assumption reflects a long-term time horizon, the plan performance in any one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence the Company’s evaluation. For 2024, the expected rate of return used in calculating the net periodic benefit costs was 6.10%. For 2025, the Company’s expected rate of return assumption is 6.60% to reflect the Company’s current view of long-term capital market outlook.

Plan Assets

Moody’s investment objective for the assets in the funded pension plan is to earn total returns that will minimize future contribution requirements over the long-term within a prudent level of risk. The Company works with its independent investment consultants to determine asset allocation targets for its pension plan investment portfolio based on its assessment of business and financial conditions, demographic and actuarial data, funding characteristics, and related risk factors. Other relevant factors, including historical and forward looking views of inflation and capital market returns, are also considered. Risk management practices include monitoring plan asset performance, diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. The Company’s Asset Management Committee is responsible for overseeing the investment activities of the plan, which includes selecting acceptable asset classes, defining allowable ranges of holdings by asset class and by individual investment managers, defining acceptable securities within each asset class, and establishing investment performance expectations. Ongoing monitoring of the plan includes reviews of investment performance and managers on a regular basis, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.

The Company’s investment policy uses risk-controlled investment strategies by increasing the plan’s asset allocation to fixed income securities and specifying ranges of acceptable target allocation by asset class based on different levels of the plan’s accounting funded status. In addition, the investment policy also requires the investment-grade fixed income assets to be rebalanced between shorter and longer duration bonds as the interest rate environment changes. This investment policy is designed to help protect the plan’s funded status and to limit volatility of the Company’s contributions. Based on the policy, the Company’s current target asset allocation is approximately 35% (range of 23% to 46%) in equity securities, 61% (range of 44% to 77%) in fixed income securities and 5% (range of 2% to 8%) in other investments and the plan will use a combination of active and passive investment strategies and different investment styles for its investment portfolios within each asset class. The plan’s equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks of small, medium and large capitalization. The plan’s fixed income investments are diversified principally across U.S. and non-U.S. government and corporate bonds, which are expected to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with obligations. The plan also invests in other fixed income investments such as debts rated below investment grade, emerging market debt, and convertible securities. The plan’s other investment, which is made through a private real estate debt fund, is expected to provide additional diversification benefits and absolute return enhancement to the plan assets.

(1)Investments are measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient and have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the value of the total plan assets.

Cash and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in money market mutual funds. In determining fair value, Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets. Investments in common/collective trust and private mutual funds are valued using the NAV per unit in each fund. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying investments owned by each fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding. Common/collective trust funds and the private mutual fund are categorized in Level 2 to the extent that they are considered to have a readily determinable fair value. Investments for which fair value is estimated by using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

Except for the Company’s U.S. funded pension plan, all of Moody’s Retirement Plans are unfunded and therefore have no plan assets.

Cash Flows

The Company did not contribute to its U.S. funded pension plan during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and does not anticipate making a contribution to the funded plan in 2025. For its unfunded plans, actual contributions in 2024 were not material and expected payments in 2025 are not expected to be material.

Defined Contribution Plans

Moody’s has a Profit Participation Plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Profit Participation Plan provides for an employee salary deferral and the Company matches employee contributions, equal to 50% of employee contribution up to a maximum of 3% of the employee’s pay. Effective January 1, 2008, all new hires are automatically enrolled in the Profit Participation Plan when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. As the Company’s U.S. DBPPs are closed to new entrants effective January 1, 2008, all eligible new hires will instead receive a retirement contribution into the Profit Participation Plan in value similar to the pension benefits. Additionally, effective January 1, 2008, the Company implemented a deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which is unfunded and provides for employee deferral of compensation and Company matching contributions related to compensation in excess of the IRS limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified retirement plans. Total expenses associated with U.S. defined contribution plans were $73 million, $71 million and $35 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Effective January 1, 2008, Moody’s has designated the Moody’s Stock Fund, an investment option under the Profit Participation Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in the Moody’s Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the Moody’s Stock Fund. Dividend payments relating to the Moody’s Stock Fund were immaterial in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The Company records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. The Moody’s Stock Fund held approximately 304,076 and 315,400 shares of Moody’s common stock at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Non-U.S. Plans

Certain of the Company’s non-U.S. operations provide pension benefits to their employees. The non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are immaterial. For defined contribution plans, company contributions are primarily determined as a percentage of employees’ eligible compensation. Expenses related to these defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $50 million, $42 million, and $37 million, respectively.

NOTE 14 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

Under the 1998 Plan, 33.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for issuance. The 2001 Plan, which is shareholder approved, permits the granting of up to 54.6 million shares, of which not more than 10.7 million shares are available for grants of awards other than stock options. The stock plans also provide for the granting of restricted stock. The stock plans provide that options are exercisable not later than ten years from the grant date. The vesting period for awards under the stock plans is generally determined by the Board at the date of the grant and has been four years except for employees who are at or near retirement eligibility, as defined, for which vesting is between one and four years. Additionally, the vesting period is between two and four years for certain performance-based restricted stock that contain a condition whereby the number of shares that ultimately vest are based on the achievement of certain non-market based performance metrics of the Company. Options may not be granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant.

The Company maintains the Directors’ Plan for its Board, which permits the granting of awards in the form of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock or performance shares. The vesting period is determined by the Board at the date of the grant and is generally one year for both options and restricted stock. Under the Directors’ Plan, 1.7 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. Any director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date that an award is granted is eligible to participate in the Directors’ Plan.

Presented below is a summary of the stock-based compensation expense and associated tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Tax benefit| $| 48 | | | $| 45 | | | $| 41 | |   

The fair value of each employee stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted below. The expected dividend yield is derived from the annual dividend rate on the date of grant. The expected stock volatility is based on an assessment of historical weekly stock prices of the Company as well as implied volatility from Moody’s traded options. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. government zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to the expected holding period. The expected holding period is determined by examining historical and projected post-vesting exercise behavior activity.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between Moody’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the year ended December 31, 2024 and the exercise prices, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of December 31, 2024. This amount varies based on the fair value of Moody’s stock. As of December 31, 2024, there was $12 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to options. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

As of December 31, 2024, there was $56 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to this plan. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy shares issued under stock-based compensation plans.

In addition, the Company also sponsors the ESPP. Under the ESPP, 6.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock of the Company on a monthly basis at a discount to the average of the high and the low trading prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of each month. This discount was 5% in 2024, 2023, and 2022, resulting in the ESPP qualifying for non-compensatory status under ASC Topic 718. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for the ESPP in 2024, 2023, and 2022. The employee purchases are funded through after-tax payroll deductions, which plan participants can elect from one percent to ten percent of compensation, subject to the annual federal limit.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, which resulted in significant changes to U.S. corporate tax laws. The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time deemed repatriation tax (“transition tax”) on previously untaxed accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and beginning in 2018 reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Accordingly, the Company determined the transition tax to be $236 million, with the remaining balance due of $12 million as of December 31, 2024. 

As a result of the Tax Act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to U.S. tax. The Company regularly evaluates which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings. The Company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested.

The Company’s annual tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 includes excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $27 million, the favorable resolution of certain U.S. and non-U.S. UTPs of $11 million, and other net decreases to tax positions of $2 million. 

The Company had valuation allowances of $25 million and $24 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to foreign net operating losses for which realization is uncertain.

Moody’s Corporation and subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state, local and multiple foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination. The Company’s New York City tax returns for 2018 through 2022 are currently under examination and 2023 is open for examination. The Company’s U.K. tax returns from 2017 to 2023 remain open to examination. 

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $211 million of UTPs. Given the number of years and nature of matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions both in the U.S. and internationally, the Company is unable to estimate a range of possible changes to its UTPs for 2025. It is also possible that new issues might be raised by tax authorities which might necessitate increases to the balance of UTPs. As the Company is unable to predict the timing of conclusion of these audits, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of changes to the balance of UTPs at this time. However, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for its financial exposure relating to all open tax years, by tax jurisdiction, in accordance with ASC Topic 740. 

The Company classifies interest related to UTPs in interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized in other non-operating (expense) income, net. Refer to Note 16 for disclosure of interest (expense) income relating to UTPs and other tax-related liabilities. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the amount of accrued interest recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to UTPs was $47 million, $36 million and $47 million, respectively.

In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a corporate minimum tax on book earnings of 15%, an excise tax on corporate share repurchases of 1%, and certain climate change and energy tax credit incentives. The adoption of a corporate minimum tax of 15% did not have a significant impact on Moody’s ETR. The excise tax of 1% on corporate share buybacks is recorded to shareholders' equity and does not have an impact on the Company’s ETR.

Effective in 2024, multiple foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates have enacted legislation to adopt a minimum tax rate described in the Global Anti-Base Erosion tax model rules (referred to as GloBE or Pillar II) issued by the OECD. A minimum ETR of 15% would apply to multinational companies with consolidated revenue above €750 million. Under the GloBE rules, a company would be required to determine a combined ETR for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional tax rate is less than 15%, an additional tax generally will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. As of December 31, 2024, the Pillar II minimum tax did not have a material impact on the Company's full year results of operations or financial position.

On May 6, 2024, the Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility with the capacity to borrow up to $1.25 billion, which expires in May 2029. The 2024 Credit Facility replaces the Company's $1.25 billion 2021 Credit Facility that was scheduled to mature in December 2026. Further information on the key terms of these revolving credit facilities is below: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Interest on borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility is payable at rates that are based on an adjusted term SOFR Rate plus a premium that can range from 80.5 BPS to 122.5 BPS, depending on the Company’s index debt ratings, as set forth in the 2024 Credit Facility. The Company also has the option to choose other rates, such as those based on adjusted Daily Simple SOFR or an alternate base rate, as set forth in the 2024 Credit Facility. Regardless of borrowing activity under the 2024 Credit Facility, the Company pays quarterly fees for the 2024 Credit Facility that can range from 7 BPS of the 2024 Credit Facility amount to 15 BPS, depending on the Company’s index debt ratings. The 2024 Credit Facility contains certain customary covenants and also contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a total debt to EBITDA Ratio of (i) not more than 4 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter or (ii) not more than 4.5 to 1 as of the end of the first three consecutive quarters immediately following any acquisition with consideration in excess of $500 million, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the 2024 Credit Facility.

Commercial Paper

On August 3, 2016, the Company entered into a private placement commercial paper program under which the Company may issue CP notes up to a maximum amount of $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the CP Program are backstopped by the 2024 Credit Facility. Amounts under the CP Program may be re-borrowed. The maturity of the CP Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The CP Notes are sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions. The rates of interest will depend on whether the CP Notes will be a fixed or floating rate. The interest on a floating rate may be based on the following: (a) certificate of deposit rate; (b) commercial paper rate; (c) the federal funds rate; (d) the SOFR; (e) prime rate; (f) Treasury rate; or (g) such other base rate as may be specified in a supplement to the private placement agreement. The CP Program contains certain events of default including, among other things: non-payment of principal, interest or fees; entrance into any form of moratorium; and bankruptcy and insolvency events, subject in certain instances to cure periods. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has no CP borrowings outstanding.

Notes Payable

At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained within all of the debt agreements. All of the debt agreements contain cross default provisions which state that default under one of the aforementioned debt instruments could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those instruments to be immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2024, there were no such cross defaults.

The repayment schedule for the Company’s borrowings is as follows:| | | | |

NOTE 17 CAPITAL STOCK

Authorized Capital Stock

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Company has authority to issue under its Restated Certificate of Incorporation is 1.02 billion shares with a par value of $0.01, of which 1.0 billion are shares of common stock, 10.0 million are shares of preferred stock and 10.0 million are shares of series common stock. The preferred stock and series common stock can be issued with varying terms, as determined by the Board.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company first implemented a systematic share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2005 through an SEC Rule 10b5-1 program and has maintained its program since. Moody’s may also purchase opportunistically when conditions warrant. As a result, Moody’s share repurchase activity will continue to vary from quarter to quarter. The table below summarizes the Company’s remaining authority under its share repurchase program as of December 31, 2024:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Date Authorized| | Amount Authorized| | Remaining Authority  
October 15, 2024| | $| 1,500 | | | $| 1,500 |   
February 5, 2024| | 1,000 | | | 67 |   
Total Remaining Authority at December 31, 2024| | | | $| 1,567 |   

During 2024, Moody’s repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program and issued a net 0.7 million shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. The net amount includes shares withheld for employee payroll taxes.

Accordingly, the ROU Assets and operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 do not reflect the amounts for this lease. This operating lease will commence in 2025 with a lease term of 15 years.

NOTE 19 CONTINGENCIES

Given the nature of the Company's activities, Moody’s and its subsidiaries are subject to legal and tax proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations, subpoenas and other inquiries, and claims and litigation by governmental and private parties that are based on ratings assigned by MIS or that are otherwise incidental to the Company’s business. Moody’s and MIS also are subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations and investigations by regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties or restrictions on business activities. On September 3, 2024, MIS settled charges by the SEC for failure to comply with record preservation requirements applicable to MIS. The settlement followed an investigation relating to certain business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that had not been approved by MIS. The SEC has settled similar charges with other NRSROs and other registrants subject to record preservation requirements. The terms of MIS’s settlement included the payment of a $20 million civil monetary penalty. As previously disclosed, the Company had accrued that amount in its consolidated financial statements. Moody’s also is subject to ongoing tax audits as addressed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

Management periodically assesses the Company’s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest information available. For claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the Company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. When the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. In instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. As additional information becomes available, the Company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. Moody’s also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to SEC rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.

In view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. The Company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. However, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.

NOTE 20 SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company is organized into two operating segments: MA and MIS and accordingly, the Company reports in two reportable segments: MA and MIS.

The MA segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets. The MA segment consists of three LOBs - DS, R&I, and D&I.

MOODY'S 2024 10-K 113

* * *

Table of Contents

The MIS segment consists of five LOBs. The CFG, FIG, PPIF and SFG LOBs generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide. The MIS Other LOB primarily consists of financial instruments pricing services in the Asia-Pacific region, ICRA non-ratings revenue and revenue from providing professional services.

Revenue for MA and expenses for MIS include an intersegment fee charged to MIS from MA for certain MA products and services utilized in MIS’s ratings process. Additionally, revenue for MIS and expenses for MA include intersegment fees charged to MA for the rights to use and distribute content, data and products developed by MIS. These intersegment fees are generally based on the market value of the products and services being transferred between the segments.

Overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy, information technology and support staff such as finance, human resources and legal. Such costs and corporate expenses that exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment. 

For overhead costs and corporate expenses that benefit both segments, costs are generally allocated to each segment based on historical revenue amounts. 

“Eliminations” in the following table represent intersegment revenue/expense. Moody’s does not report the Company’s assets by reportable segment, as this metric is not used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments.

Financial Information by Segment

The table below presents revenue, significant expenses regularly provided to the CODM and Adjusted Operating Income by reportable segment. The CODM, identified as the Company's CEO, utilizes the Adjusted Operating Income measure to assess the profitability of the Company and each of its reportable segments each quarter. Adjusted Operating Income is also used in our budgeting and forecasting processes, enabling the allocation of capital resources across the Company's strategic initiatives.
