Item 1. Business

Overview

Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions. These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data. Our capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Strategic Priorities

Consumer payments.  We focus on enabling consumer payments, providing consumers with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards, real-time payments and account-based transactions), while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and seamless. We do so by:

•Capturing the significant secular opportunity of cash displacement by increasing acceptance through advancing technology and partnering with players across the payments ecosystem, as well as by opening up closed-loop and domestic networks. We also pursue incremental volume and transactions by extending our reach across under-penetrated card verticals (such as bill pay) and real-time account-based payments

•Driving brand preference through compelling consumer experiences by offering relevant value propositions to consumers (including features, benefits and experiences), providing comprehensive digital functionality (such as Digital First), delivering enhanced security and functionality (increasing tokenization, scaling authentication and streamlining online checkout) and driving increased approval, spend and activation rates

•Investing in the future and driving market transformation by extending the reach of our network to enable the tokenization of credentials, identities, assets and data and the exchange of those items between counterparties (providing security, privacy and control). We also seek to achieve this transformation by modernizing our card switch to meet evolving needs 

Commercial and new payment flows. We focus on capturing opportunities in commercial payments (both point-of-sale purchases and invoiced payments) and disbursements and remittances (specifically, through Mastercard Move, our collection of money movement capabilities that provides solutions for money transfers to consumers from consumers, businesses or governments). We do so by:

•Accelerating secular shift in commercial point-of-sale purchases by offering differentiated propositions across cards and platforms (both corporate and small business solutions, including expense management, reporting, reconciliation and data insights); expanding distribution of our point-of-sale offerings across financial institutions, new geographies, new channels and small businesses; and growing acceptance

•Capturing commercial invoiced payments by driving engagement across buyers and suppliers to, among other things, simplify workflows, release working capital and improve data reconciliation to reduce end-to-end costs; building on our travel offerings to expand into additional select verticals (including business-to-business (“B2B”) marketplaces, trade and logistics, healthcare, consumer packaged goods and pharmaceuticals); and embedding payments into widely used platforms and workflows 

•Modernizing disbursements and remittances by utilizing Mastercard Move to scale use cases across senders (including consumers, businesses and governments) and receiving consumers (both domestic and cross-border) and expand money movement across our global network of financial institution partners

Services and other solutions. Our services and other solutions, which are interdependent with our payment network, drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem. We offer security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement, business and market insights, gateway, processing and open banking, among other services and solutions (including ACH batch and real-time account-based payments and solutions). As we drive value, our services and other solutions generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial performance. We do so by:

•Differentiating our payments capabilities by combining our wide range of services and solutions in various ways to meet the needs and priorities of our partners, which helps drive market wins and payments growth 

•Enhancing and expanding our suite of services to better serve our existing customers, including across new buying centers and new capability areas, as well as to reach new customers 

•Scaling distribution by using our technology platforms to enable us to switch more transactions and deliver more services per transaction, selling directly to customers through a dedicated sales force and global account teams, and embedding services with partners (such as tech platforms, system integrators, processors and other networks) to deliver those services at scale

Our priorities are fundamentally interdependent and strengthen, reinforce and complement each other. 

| | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | •Our payments network helps us scale our services and solutions, and those services and solutions help us differentiate our payments solutions•We grow in payments, which allows us to switch more transactions and bring more transaction data onto the network•We use that data to create insightful services and solutions that can, in turn, help us win new and renewed customer deals and drive greater payments volume growth  

Enabling Our Success

These priorities are supported by six enablers:

People. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of our people. We attract, develop and retain top talent, in alignment with our strategic priorities. Our winning culture is guided by the Mastercard Way, which outlines the behaviors we expect from employees to deliver for our customers and one another. We foster a working environment that benefits and provides equal opportunities for all of our employees, where people have opportunities to perform purpose-driven work that advances our business objectives by delivering a positive impact on communities, customers and co-workers across the globe.

Brand. Our brands and brand identities serve as a differentiator for our business, representing our values and enabling us to accelerate growth in new areas. 

Data and AI. We create a range of products and services for our customers using our data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) assets, technology, platforms and expertise. We follow our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes are designed to ensure we embed multiple layers of privacy, data protection and information security controls in all our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data and privacy. 

Technology.  Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility in how we serve customers. It unlocks broader reach to scale digital payment services to multiple channels. Utilizing our technology standards, services and governance model, we connect financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs) and others, enabling interoperability and allowing consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to engage through digital channels.

Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders who participate in our global payments network. Our franchise model creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We provide a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation and safety and security of our network. Our franchise model enables the scale of our network and provides a single governance structure for its operation. This structure has the potential to be extended to new opportunities. 

Doing Well by Doing Good. Sustainable impact is fundamental to our business strategy. We leverage our employees, technology, resources, partnerships and expertise to address social, economic and environmental challenges, while at the same time creating markets for future growth and driving long-term value for stockholders. Our environmental, social and governance priorities are expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all of the work we do is grounded in strong governance principles. For more information, please reference our most recently published Environmental, Social and Governance Report located on our website.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Business

Our Payments Capabilities 

We enable a wide variety of payments capabilities (including products, services and solutions) over our network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, governments and others, offering our customers one partner for their payment needs. 

Payment Network

Our payment network links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use our products at approximately 150 million acceptance locations and over 250 million digital access points worldwide. This network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure means for making and receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network. We enable transactions for our customers through our payment network in more than 150 currencies and in more than 220 countries and territories. 

Payment Network Transactions. Our payment network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution). 

We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers. 

The following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our payment network and our role in that transaction, which includes services and other solutions and payments ecosystem security:

In a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.

•Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed payments and improved customer experience. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

•Additional Four-Party System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit. 

Switched Transactions 

•Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our payment network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
•Cross-Border and Domestic.  Our payment network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country and country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”). We switch approximately 70% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions.| | Key 2024 Developments  
| •In 2024, we began processing domestic transactions in China through our joint venture. Mastercard-branded cards are now accepted for both domestic and cross-border purchases.|

We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to help ensure the integrity of our payment network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.

Payment Network Architecture.  Our payment network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple services (such as fraud scoring, tokenization services, etc.) to appropriate transactions in real time. This architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class response time.

Account-Based Payments Capabilities

We offer ACH batch and real-time account-based payments capabilities, enabling payments for ACH transactions between bank accounts in real-time. Our real-time account-based payments capabilities provide consumers and businesses the ability to make instant (faster) payments while providing enhanced data and messaging capabilities. We build, implement, enhance and operate real-time clearing and settlement infrastructure, payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. We operate real-time payments infrastructure in several countries around the world. We also use our real-time account-based payments capabilities to enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. 

We discuss below under “Our Payment Products and Applications” the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based payments capabilities to capture new payment flows. 

Security and Franchise

Payments Ecosystem Security.  We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem, including a robust program designed to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise resilience program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We work with experts across the organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of cyber and physical threats, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third-party providers.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

As another feature of our multi-layered approach, we work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and payments industry associations to develop and put in place technical standards for safe and secure transactions, and we provide solutions and products that are designed to help provide safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. Our approach includes supporting small businesses by sharing best practices and providing access to free utilities and services, benefiting both them and the entire payments ecosystem. We discuss specific security solutions that we offer to our customers below under “Services and Other Solutions”. 

Our Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our global payments network, setting standards and rules for all participants and aiming to ensure interoperability among them while balancing risk and value across all stakeholders. Our franchise model achieves this by creating and sustaining a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. Through our franchise model, we work to ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants may benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this goal through the following key activities: 

•Participant Onboarding. We determine that each new customer meets the necessary prerequisites to use and contribute to our network by defining clear ecosystem roles and responsibilities for their operations

•Operating Standards. We define the technical, operational and financial standards that all network participants are required to uphold

•Safety and Security. We establish central principles, including safeguarding consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network 

•Responsible Stewardship. We set performance standards to support ecosystem optimization and growth and use proactive monitoring designed to both ensure participant adherence to operating standards and protect the integrity of the ecosystem

•Issue Resolution. We operate a framework to address disputes between our network participants

Prepaid.  Prepaid accounts are a type of electronic payment that enables consumers to pay from pre-funded accounts whether or not they previously had a bank account or a credit history. These accounts can be tailored to meet specific program, customer or consumer needs, such as paying bills, sending person-to-person payments or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Our focus ranges from digital accounts (such as fintech and gig economy platforms) to business programs such as employee payroll, health savings accounts and solutions for small business owners. Our prepaid programs also offer opportunities in the private and public sectors to drive financial inclusion of previously unbanked individuals through social security payments, unemployment benefits and salary cards.

Consumer Bill Payments. Our solutions enable consumers and small businesses to pay their billers in a seamless and secure way, providing an experience that offers flexibility and benefits consumers, financial institutions and billers.

•We partner with digital messaging and payment platforms to enable consumers to send money directly within applications to other consumers. •We partner with central banks, fintechs and financial institutions to help governments and nonprofits more efficiently enable, as applicable, distribution of social and economic assistance and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) disbursements across various use cases (such as wallet funding, cash payouts, gig worker payouts and insurance claims).•We enable a wide range of cross-border payment flows and use cases to customers (including trade payments, remittances and disbursements). These flows are enabled via a distribution network with a single point of access that allows financial institutions, fintechs and digital partners to send and receive money globally through multiple channels, including bank accounts, mobile wallets, cards and cash payouts.| | Key 2024 Developments  
| •In 2024, we launched our Alias-Based Remittances and Payouts platform, which is designed to remove the friction of manually capturing required information to complete cross-border remittances and disbursements. The solution simplifies the experience for both senders and receivers by using a beneficiary’s existing alias (such as their phone number or email) instead of requiring senders to ask for personal information or manually entering such information into numerous fields in order to make cross-border payments.|

Revenue Sources 

Mastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from a wide range of payments solutions we provide to our customers. We classify our net revenues, which include the impact of rebates and incentives, from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions. 

Within our payment network, revenue is primarily generated from charging fees to our customers based on GDV (which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry our brands and for providing switching and other network-related services. 

Within our value-added services and solutions, we generate revenue primarily related to the following:

Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations. These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.

Competition

We face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry. We compete in all categories of payments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide services and solutions:

•General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally, financial institutions may issue both Mastercard- and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express-, China UnionPay- and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products. 

•Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks. In various countries, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.

•Real-time Account-based Payments Systems. We face competition in the ACH and real-time account-based payments space from providers of infrastructure, applications and services. As these real-time account-based propositions mature, we face a possible increase in competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant (“P2M”) and person-to-person (“P2P”) transaction market share. Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing cross-border P2M and P2P market share. Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.

•Digital Wallets and other Fintechs. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card. Examples include digital wallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services, device manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers. 

•Digital Public Infrastructure and Other Government-Backed Solutions. Governments have been focused on creating and expanding local digital payments structures. Increasingly, these structures include digital public infrastructure (DPI), which is owned by governments and often supported by third parties, and aim to provide payments services as a public good. Government- and central bank-backed structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”), which may be launched with their own networks to transfer money between participants.

•Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment

service providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2M, while some banks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments. Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto natives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an opportunity for us, but could equally compete with our products and services.

•Services and Solutions Providers. We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our services and solutions. These companies include information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our other solutions, including open banking. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.

We play a valuable role as a trusted intermediary in a complex system, creating value for individual stakeholders and the payments ecosystem overall. Our competitive advantages include:

| | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Global network| Highly adaptable and world class global payments network that can reach a variety of parties to enable payments anywhere  
| Franchise model| Establishing rules, standards and bearing of financial risk (including our settlement guarantee backed by our strong credit standing) that allows for interoperability among all participants  
| Multi-rail| Multiple payments capabilities based on our innovation and technology that enable choice  
| Brand| Globally recognized and trusted brands  
| Data and AI| Products and services utilizing our data and AI assets, technology, platforms and expertise that incorporate our Data and Tech Responsibility Principles and reflect our Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance processes

| Technology| Leading-edge technology that advances the quality, speed and diversity of our offerings and solutions  
| Government engagement| Ability to serve a broad array of participants in global payments due to our expanded on-soil presence in individual markets and a heightened focus on working with governments  

Collectively, the capabilities that we have created organically, and those that we have obtained through acquisitions, support and build upon each other to enhance the total proposition we offer our customers. They enable us to partner with many participants in the broader payments ecosystem and provide choice, security and services to improve the value we provide to our customers.

Government Regulation

As a technology company in the global payments industry, we are subject to government regulation that impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to the laws and regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our products and services are used. We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations and implementing policies, procedures and programs designed to promote compliance. We monitor and coordinate globally while acting locally and establish relationships to assess and manage the effects of regulation on us. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples of the regulation to which we are subject. 

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Payments Oversight and Regulation. Central banks and other regulators around the world either have established, or are seeking to establish, formal oversight over participants in the payments industry, as well as authority to regulate payments systems in their countries. Such authority has resulted in certain of these entities regulating Mastercard as financial market infrastructure, as well as establishing oversight related to various aspects of our business (including areas such as consumer protections and cybersecurity). In the European Union (the “EU”), Mastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation, which includes various requirements we must meet, including obligations related to governance and risk management. In the U.K., the Bank of England designated Vocalink™, our real-time account-based payments network platform, as a “specified service provider”, and Mastercard as a “recognized payment system”, which includes supervisions and examination requirements. In addition, EU legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities (brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market, make decisions and organize our structure. Examples of other markets where Mastercard is formally overseen include Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and Canada. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are also regulated as payments institutions and payment service providers, including as money transmitters. This regulation subjects us to licensing obligations, regulatory supervision and examinations, as well as various business conduct and risk management requirements.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees that support the function and value of four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation. Examples include statutes in the U.S. that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities, proposed legislation in the U.S. to extend routing mandates to credit, our settlement with the European Commission (the “EC”) resolving its investigation into our interregional interchange fees and the EU legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For more detail, see “Risk Factors - Other Regulation” in Part I, Item 1A and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.| | Key 2024 Developments|   
| •In May 2024, the state of Illinois passed the Interchange Fee Prohibition Act, which prohibits the assessment of interchange on the tax and gratuity portion of an electronic payment transaction. This law is subject to litigation regarding its validity.|   
| •Legislation was introduced in the 117th U.S. Congress (2023-2024) that would extend routing mandates for Mastercard and Visa to credit. The bill, which is no longer active but could be reintroduced in the new Congress, stipulated that the top two networks could not be enabled on the same card, leaving room for regional networks to serve as second options. The bill proposed to mandate Mastercard provide authentication, tokenization or other security technology to competing networks, whether or not the transaction is switched by Mastercard.|   
| •In October 2024, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a rule requiring data providers to make covered data available to consumers and authorized third parties, promoting industry standard-setting bodies recognized by the CFPB, and outlining obligations for third parties accessing data on behalf of consumers (including limitations on the collection, use and retention of covered data). The rule provides for phased-in compliance deadlines, which start in April 2026 and are tiered based on institution size. |   
| •In November 2024, in compliance with newly effective registration requirements under the Retail Payment Activities Act in Canada, Mastercard registered its entities that provide certain defined payment functions with the Bank of Canada. These entities are required to implement operational risk, safeguarding of funds, and reporting frameworks under the Act by September 2025. |

Preferential or Protective Government Actions.  Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers. For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies. Some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting or have adopted data localization requirements, which mandate the collection, storage, and/or other processing of data within their borders. This is the case, for instance, in India, China and Saudi Arabia. Various forms of data localization requirements or data transfer restrictions are also under consideration in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU. 

Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption.  We are subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the European Union. We have implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program, comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”). We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including establishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and U.S. and EU sanctions programs. In the U.S., these obligations include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran and Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk.

Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, which can indirectly impact us. Additionally, regulations such as the EU’s Payment Services Directive in the EEA require financial institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from Mastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products. Authorities in the EU are also revising standards relating to the authentication of transactions, which may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.

Regulation of Internet and High-Risk Merchant Categories. Various jurisdictions have enacted regulation related to internet transactions (such as laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports), which impacts both us and our customers. We are also impacted by evolving laws surrounding certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco. 

Privacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security.  Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data, AI and information security laws and regulations in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world. For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respectively subject to, among other laws and regulations, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and, increasingly, a number of state data and privacy laws. We and our customers may also be subject to evolving U.S. federal and/or state AI laws and regulations. With respect to information security, we are subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) disclosure rules that require, among other things, disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protection and information security program to protect the personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations, although divergences have occurred. Laws and regulations in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensitive data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI (which is now subject to regulation in the EU as well as other places). In

addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance.

Sustainability Disclosures. Various jurisdictions have adopted or are increasingly considering adopting laws, regulations and oversight expectations requiring disclosure on environmental, social and governance matters. Regulations already adopted or being considered include required corporate reporting and disclosures on topics with respect to climate, such as the U.K. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“EU CSRD”), and, to the extent they become effective, SEC rules related to climate change. Other adopted or potential regulations focus on social topics, including human rights, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, the treatment of employees and diversity of workforce, such as in the EU CSRD.

Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us, including evolving laws and guidance surrounding buy-now-pay-later, open banking, credit reporting, digital currencies, marijuana, prepaid payroll cards, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, marketing and operational resilience.

Legal and Regulatory

Payments Industry Regulation

Global regulatory and legislative activity related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Central banks and similar regulatory bodies have increasingly established or further expanded their authority over certain aspects of payments systems such as ours, including obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer, the countries in which our products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services. Similarly, jurisdictions that regulate a particular product may consider extending their jurisdiction to other products. For example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit products. Moreover, several jurisdictions are demonstrating increased interest about the network fees we charge to our customers (in some cases as part of broader market reviews of retail payments), which could in the future lead to regulation relating to our network fees. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a “systemically important payment system”, with other regulators considering similar designations. This type of regulation and oversight is related to switching activities, and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified service provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”. The impact to our business created by any new law, regulation or designation is magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in, or conflict with, other jurisdictions, or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction.

Our strategic expansion of our products and services has also created the need for us to obtain new types and increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses that typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital, safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations. 

Increased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our other products or services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and/or limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, any regulation that is enacted related to the type and level of network fees we charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such 

MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K 25

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

changes, which could negatively impact us. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.

Increased activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.

Interchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of products associated with our payment network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).

Governments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, regulation and litigation. See “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.

If issuers cannot collect or we are required to reduce interchange rates, issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party payments system. Alternatively, they may reduce the benefits associated with our products, choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services, or seek a fee reduction from us to decrease the expense of their payment programs (particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge). These and other impacts could make our products less desirable to consumers, limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive, ultimately reducing the volume of transactions over our network and our profitability.

We are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulting legislation, regulation and/or litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. In addition, regulatory proceedings and litigation could result (and in some cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil damages, the amount of which could be material.

Limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.

We have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Canada, that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means. Authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so). Additionally, our no-surcharge rules now permit U.S. and Canadian merchants to surcharge credit cards (subject to certain limitations). If, over time, an increased number of merchants choose to surcharge as permitted, this could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment. These responses could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.

Preferential or Protective Government Actions

Preferential or protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.

Governments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected national or domestic payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own national provider. These actions may displace us from, prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies, and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers. For example:

•Governments in some countries have implemented, or may implement, regulatory requirements that mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies. 

•Some jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering implementing, requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications as well as increased compliance burdens and other costs. 

•Geopolitical events and any resulting OFAC sanctions, adverse trade policies, enforcement of U.S. laws related to countering the financing of terrorism, economic sanctions and anti-corruption, or other types of government actions could lead affected or other jurisdictions to take actions in response that could adversely affect our business. Moreover, because of various concerns 

26 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

jurisdictions may have with respect to our business, including our decision to suspend business operations in Russia, such jurisdictions may decide to begin to or increase their focus on growing local payment networks and other solutions. 

•Regional groups of countries are considering, or may consider, efforts to restrict our switching of regional transactions.

•Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures, which are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. 

Such developments prevent us from utilizing our global switching capabilities for domestic or regional customers. In addition, to the extent a jurisdiction determines us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements (including those related to data localization), we have been, and may again in the future be, subject to resource and time pressures in order to come back into compliance. Our inability to effect change in, or work with, these jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand. 

Additionally, some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, foreign ownership restrictions, which could potentially have the effect of forcing or inducing the transfer of our technology and proprietary information as a condition of access to their markets. Such restrictions could adversely impact our ability to compete in these markets. 

Privacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security

Regulation and enforcement of privacy, data, AI, information security and the digital economy could increase our costs and lead to legal claims and fines, as well as negatively impact our growth and reputation.

We are subject to increasingly complex, fragmented and divergent laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, data use and governance, AI and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business. While policymakers around the globe often look to the EU and the GDPR when adopting new or updated privacy and data protection laws, divergences have occurred and continue to occur. As a result, new or updated privacy and data protection and information security laws and regulations have led, and may continue to lead, to similar, stricter or at times conflicting requirements, creating an uncertain regulatory environment. For example, some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry and other industries in which we participate, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements. In addition, laws and regulations on AI, data governance and credit decisioning may overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general privacy rules. Overall, these myriad laws and regulations may require us to modify or limit our data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and requirements (including as a result of conflicting regulations) could result in fines, sanctions or other enforcement actions or penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.

As a user and deployer of AI technology, we are also subject to increasing and evolving laws and regulations related to AI governance, including the EU AI Act, and new applications of existing laws and regulations to AI. How our use and deployment of AI will be regulated is still developing as policymakers around the world consider how to regulate AI, and uncertainty remains as to how AI technology will continue to advance. In addition, the use of AI creates or amplifies risks that are challenging to fully prevent or mitigate. In particular, AI algorithms may generate inaccurate, unintended, unfair, biased or discriminatory outcomes (which may not be easily detectable or explainable) and may inadvertently disclose confidential information and/or breach intellectual property, privacy or other rights. Our implementation of robust AI governance and risk management frameworks aimed at complying with emerging laws and regulations may not be sufficient protection against these emerging risks. 

Further, as we acquire new companies and develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace, we have expanded and may further expand our data profile through additional data types and sources, across multiple channels, and involving new partners. This expansion has amplified and may continue to amplify the impact of these various laws and regulations on our business or subject us to new laws and regulations. For example, our acquisition of Recorded Future, a global threat intelligence company, increases our exposure to certain laws and regulations, including global cybercrime and other laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we are required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate. We also need to provide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in products leveraging AI.

New requirements and rules, or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and/or restrict our ability to leverage data or use AI for innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the need for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the development of information-based products and solutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of 

MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K 27

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

issuing payment products or using information products, which may, in turn, decrease the number of our products that they offer. While we intend to comply with all regulatory requirements, innovate responsibly and deploy Privacy by Design, Data by Design and AI Governance approaches to all of our product development, the speed and pace of changes in laws (as well as stakeholder interests) may not allow us to meet rapidly evolving regulatory and stakeholder expectations. Any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. 

Other Regulation 

Regulations that directly or indirectly apply to Mastercard as a result of our participation in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many jurisdictions in which our products and services are used. Many of our customers are also subject to regulations applicable to banks and other financial institutions that, at times, consequently affect us. Such regulation has increased significantly in the last several years (as described in “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1). Examples include:

•Anti-Money Laundering, Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption. We are subject to AML and CFT laws and regulations globally. Economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies, and persons and entities. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage. 

•Account-based Payments Systems. In the U.K., aspects of our Vocalink business are subject to the U.K. payment system oversight regime and are directly overseen by the Bank of England.

•Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Certain regulations that impact our issuers and acquirers may impact various aspects of our business. For example, strong authentication requirements within the EU’s Payment Services Directive in the EEA could increase the number of transactions consumers abandon if we are unable to secure a frictionless authentication experience under these standards. Such an increase could adversely impact our volumes or other operational metrics.

Increased regulatory focus on us has resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. Similarly, increased regulatory focus on our customers and other stakeholders may cause them to reduce the volume of transactions processed through our systems, or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our products. Actions by regulators could influence other organizations around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measures, amplifying any potential compliance burden. Additionally, our compliance with new economic sanctions and related laws with respect to particular jurisdictions or customers could result in a loss of business, which could be significant. Moreover, while our risk-based compliance program obligates issuers and acquirers to comply with U.S., EU and local sanctions programs (among other obligations), the failure of those issuers and acquirers to identify potential non-compliance issues either during or after their customer onboarding processes could ultimately impact our compliance with economic sanctions and related laws. Finally, failure to comply with the laws and regulations discussed above to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions or other penalties. In particular, a violation and subsequent judgment or settlement against us, or those with whom we may be associated, under economic sanctions and AML, CFT, and anti-corruption laws could subject us to substantial monetary penalties, damages, and/or have a significant reputational impact. Each instance may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and/or our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our reputation.

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.

We are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments as well as various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Current and potential future changes in existing tax laws, including regulatory guidance, are continuously being considered and have been or may be enacted (such as guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which impact how multinational enterprises are taxed on their global profits). These changes have and in the future may continue to have an impact on our effective income tax rate and tax payments. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties, or the economy generally, have impacted and may continue to impact us. 

In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations, and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Jurisdictions around the globe have also increased tax-related audits, which require time and resources to resolve.

Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules, regulatory or judicial interpretations or guidance; any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction; or any changes in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Litigation

Liabilities or business limitations resulting from litigation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

We are a defendant in a number of civil litigations and regulatory proceedings and investigations, including among others, those alleging violations of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claims (as described in Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8). In the event we are found liable in any material litigations or proceedings (particularly in a large class-action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages or under which we were jointly and severally liable), we could be subject to significant damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Certain limitations have been placed on our business because of litigation and litigation settlements, such as changes to our no-surcharge rule in the U.S. and Canada. Any future limitations resulting from the outcomes of any litigation or regulatory proceeding, including any changes to our rules or business practices, could impact our relationships with our customers, including reducing the volume of business that we do with them, which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

Business and Operations

Competition and Technology

Substantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

The global payments industry is highly competitive. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry and compete in all payment categories, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments. We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based payments systems, digital wallets and other fintechs (focused on online activity across various channels and processing payments using in-house capabilities), digital public infrastructure and other government-backed solutions and digital currencies. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our services and other solutions. 

Our traditional competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs, services, and payment capabilities than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have. They may also introduce their own innovative programs, services and capabilities that adversely impact our growth. 

Certain of our competitors to our payment network operate three-party payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers, potentially providing competitive advantages. If we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitors because we operate a four-party system, or we are regulated because of the system we operate in a way in which our competitors are not, we could lose business to these competitors. See “Business - Competition” in Part I, Item 1.

Certain of our competitors have developed alternative, e-commerce and/or mobile device payments systems, as well as physical store locations. A number of these competitors rely principally on technology to support their services that provides cost advantages, and as a result may benefit from lower costs than we do. Many of these competitors are also able to use existing payment networks without being subject to many of the associated costs. Moreover, these competitors also occupy various roles in the payments ecosystem that enable them to influence payment choice of other participants. With respect to government-backed solutions, including those involving DPI, government participation in structures could prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies. Any of these factors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. 

Our ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation, competition-related regulatory proceedings and both central bank and legislative activity. 

If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, drive value for our customers and/or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives, we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats. Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

Disintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.

As the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including the following:

•Parties that process our transactions in certain countries (such as merchants and third-party payment processors) may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process by switching transactions directly with issuers or processing transactions directly between issuers and acquirers.

MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K 29

* * *

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

•Payments industry participants may develop their own products and services to support our switched transaction and payments offerings, forcing us to change our pricing or practices for our own offerings in order to compete. In addition, governments may promote their own national or international payments platforms, potentially putting us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or requiring us to compete differently. Moreover, as central banks experiment with CBDCs, policies and design considerations that governments adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating CBDC-based payment transactions, potentially impacting the transactions that we may process over our network.

•Payments industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-based payments, which could facilitate P2M transactions that compete with both our payment network and our additional payments capabilities. 

•Fintechs and technology companies could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments as well as develop products or services that compete with our customers and could diminish demand for our products and services. In addition, we face a heightened risk that data we share with these companies as part of our products and services could be used in a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

•Payments industry participants may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services, leverage other business models to create a competitive edge over us or create new payment products and services that compete with our products and services.

•Regulation may disintermediate issuers by enabling third-party providers opportunities to route payment transactions toward their own forms of payment by offering account information or payment initiation services directly to our product users. Such regulation may also provide these processors with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions they are servicing. Disintermediation of our customers’ business could diminish demand for our products and services.

Our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

Continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

In order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products. In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts so as to meet customer demand for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. As a result, we may not be able to grow our volume and/or services enough to compensate for the additional costs related to these increased incentives and pricing discounts. In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.

In the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and compete with others in the industry. Some of our competitors are larger with greater financial resources and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided in order to benefit from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. In addition to decisions made by competitors and customers, we also face pressure from pricing regulation and litigation. 

Additionally, we face pricing pressure related to real-time account-based payment schemes. These pressures impact both domestic pricing (such as the increased use of schemes that offer increasingly lower or subsidized P2M pricing) and cross-border pricing (including from both competing schemes and global initiatives to lower the cost of cross-border payments to end users). 

Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.

The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, including new technologies and changes to existing technologies (such as cryptocurrency and blockchain, AI, machine learning, privacy enhancement and cybersecurity). These changes could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our programs and services. They may also result in new and innovative payment methods, products and services. 

Additionally, there are a number of factors relating to technology change that could impact us. These include: the inability of third parties on which we rely for the development of and access to new technologies to keep pace with technological changes; potential action from third-party patent holders, including notices or inquiries threatening litigation against us or our customers for alleged 

30 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

patent infringement or demanding significant license fees; the scope of, as well as customer and merchant resistance to, industry-wide solutions and standards (such as those related to tokenization or other safety and security technologies); any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining employees with technology expertise; and the need to invest resources for new technologies, which could lead to further additional expenses. Any of these developments could impact our ability to develop and adopt new technologies, as well as improve and keep pace with current technologies and reflect such technology in our payments offerings. 

Moreover, regulatory or government requirements could continue to require us to host and deliver certain products and services on-soil in certain markets. As a result, we may need to alter our technology and delivery model, potentially resulting in additional expenses and/or other operational impacts. 

Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we fail to sufficiently develop and adopt new technologies, or improve and keep pace with current technologies and reflect such technology in our payments offerings, our payments offerings could be negatively impacted and/or we could be put at a competitive disadvantage. This could impact our ability to compete with new technologies and products, as well as encourage customers that use our technology to enhance and deliver their payment-related products and services (including fintechs and technology companies) to use their own technology to compete against us. These developments could lead to a decline in the use of our technology, products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Operating a real-time account-based payments network presents risks that could materially affect our business.

U.K. regulators have designated Vocalink, our real-time account-based payments network platform, to be a “specified service provider” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time account-based payments systems in similar ways. Any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts, including potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant reputational risk to Vocalink and us. For a discussion of related regulatory risks, see our risk factor in “Risk Factors - Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. Furthermore, the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address information security vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our payment network. Operational difficulties, such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products, or information security breaches on our real-time account-based payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and services, result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our reputation.

Working with new customers and end users as we continue to expand our products and services can present operational and onboarding challenges, be costly and result in reputational damage if the new products or services do not perform as intended.

The payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs. In order to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments markets, we are continually involved in developing and implementing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our products and services. These efforts carry the risks associated with any diversification initiative, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems. These projects also carry risks associated with working with different types of customers (such as corporations that are not financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and new end users). These differences may present new operational challenges, such as enhanced infrastructure and monitoring for less regulated customers.

Our failure to effectively design and deliver these products and services could make our other offerings less desirable to these customers, or put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, if there is a delay in the implementation of our products or services (which could include compliance obligations, such as AML and CFT, and licensing requirements for applicable products and services), if our products or services do not perform as anticipated, or we are unable to otherwise adequately anticipate risks related to new types of customers, we could face additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as negatively impact our brand and reputation.

Information Security and Operational Resilience

Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.

Information security risks for payments and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, “hacktivists”, terrorists, nation-states, state-sponsored actors and other external parties. These threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure or other technological failure. These threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code (including ransomware), social-engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or information security breaches and could lead to the misappropriation or loss of consumer account and other information and identity theft. These types of threats have risen 

MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K 31

* * *

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

significantly due to a significant portion of our workforce working in a hybrid environment. These threats also may be further enhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors’ use of AI.

Our operations rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. Our customers and other parties in the payments value chain, as well as account holders, rely on our digital technologies, computer systems, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers and account holders increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control. We, like other financial technology organizations, routinely are subject to cyber-threats and our technologies, systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers, have been subject to attempted cyber-attacks. Because of our position in the payments value chain, we believe that we are likely to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Geopolitical events and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threats and attacks by affected or sympathizing jurisdictions or other actors, which could put our information and assets at risk, as well as result in network disruption. 

To date, we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-party provider systems) or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information (including account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure, networks or operations systems that support our business and customers (such as the lack of availability of our services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers, other stakeholders and the broader payments ecosystem, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdictions in which we are deemed critical national infrastructure. If such attacks are not detected immediately, or disclosed as required by law, their effect could be compounded.

In addition to information security risks for our systems and networks, we also routinely encounter account data compromise events involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment transaction data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of account holders. Further events of this type may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment products carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or brands resulting from an account data breach of our systems and networks or those of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our products and services. Such events could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payments. In addition to reputational concerns, the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise events could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such events by, among other things, making it more difficult to identify consumers. Moreover, while most of the lawsuits resulting from account data breaches do not involve direct claims against us and while we have releases from many issuers and acquirers, we could still face damage claims, which, if upheld, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. While we offer security solutions that are designed to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that such security solutions will perform as expected or address all possible security threats. Real or perceived defects, failures, errors or vulnerabilities in our security solutions could adversely impact our reputation, customer confidence in our solutions and our business and may subject us to litigation, governmental audits and investigation or other liabilities. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed on us.

In addition, companies have generally experienced in recent years an increase in fraudulent activity and cyber-attacks. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting or other fraud and may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI. As outsourcing and specialization become common in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our payment products. We continue to take measures to make card and digital payments more secure. However, increased fraud levels and cyber-attacks involving our products, services and/or network, or misconduct or negligence by third parties switching or otherwise servicing our products and services could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our products and services and/or increase our compliance costs. Further, such occurrences have resulted in and could further result in legislative or regulatory intervention, which could lead to enhanced security requirements and liabilities. See “Risk Factors - Privacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security Compliance” in this Part I, Item 1A for more detail concerning related legal risks and obligations. 

Despite various mitigation efforts that we undertake, there can be no assurance that we, or third parties with which we work, will not suffer material breaches and resulting losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to protect us from such losses as well as any liabilities or damages with respect to claims alleging compromises of our confidential, proprietary, sensitive or personal information or our technologies, systems or networks. In addition, we cannot be sure 

32 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K

* * *

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent role in the global payments ecosystem, our continued implementation of our strategic priorities, our extensive use of third-party vendors and potential vulnerabilities from previous and future acquisitions, strategic investments or related opportunities. As a result, we remain focused on the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our computer systems, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

Service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could reduce our operational resilience and materially affect our overall business and results of operations.

Our transaction switching systems and other offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, supply-chain attacks, fire, floods, earthquakes, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events (including those related to climate change). We have experienced in limited instances, and may continue to experience, some types of these interruptions. Our visibility in the global payments industry may also put us at greater risk of attack by terrorists, activists, or hackers who intend to disrupt our facilities, networks and/or systems. Inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network. If one of our service providers fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruptions, terrorism, hacking or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services. Although we maintain an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks. Due to the intrinsic importance of our switching systems to our business, any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands and materially adversely affect our overall business and our results of operations.

Stakeholder Relationships

Losing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.

Many of our customer relationships are not exclusive. Our customers can reassess their future commitments to us subject to the terms of our contracts, and they separately may develop their own services that compete with ours. Our business agreements with these customers may not ultimately reduce the risk (inherent in our business) that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.

In addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. Loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Exclusive/near exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business. 

While we have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with certain of our customers to issue payment products, other customers have similar exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with these customers to increase our revenues. In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned. A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.

Consolidation amongst our customers could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.

The industries in which our customers participate have undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past. These consolidations have included customers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor. Potential future consolidation could occur as a result of bank failures, similar to those that occurred in the U.S. in recent years. If significant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

bargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.

While we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system (including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and other technology companies), we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See “Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations” in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations.

With the exception of the U.S. and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using cards with our brands are switched by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries or have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.

Merchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and/or increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.

Merchants are important constituents in our payments system. We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, we believe a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in addition to interchange. See “Risk Factors – Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment (including digital) may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.

Certain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition of accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows, our business could suffer.

Our work with governments exposes us to risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.

As we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

•Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and result in scope changes or termination of the arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect to our products and services.

•Our work with governments is heavily regulated, subjecting us to additional potential exposure under U.S. and international anti-corruption laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as compliance with various procurement and other laws, regulations, standards and contract terms. Any violation and subsequent judgment or settlement related to the above could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages and have a significant reputational impact.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Moreover, as a government contractor, we are subject to a government’s right to conduct audits and investigations into both our contract performance and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Any adverse finding could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or disbarment. 

•Working or contracting with governments, either directly or via our financial institution customers, can subject us to heightened reputational risks, including extensive scrutiny and publicity, as well as a potential association with the policies of those governments. Any negative publicity or negative association with a government entity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, threat intelligence gathering services provided to governments through our acquisition of Recorded Future could negatively impact how we are viewed by other jurisdictions. 

Any of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations. 

Global Economic and Political Environment

Global economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

Adverse economic trends. Adverse economic trends in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance. Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:

•Customers mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new Mastercard products and requesting greater incentive or greater cost stability from us 

•Consumers and businesses reducing spending, which could impact domestic and cross-border spend

•Debt limit and budgetary discussions in the U.S. have affected, and could further affect, the U.S. credit rating, impacting consumer confidence and spending

•Government intervention (including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments on or in our financial institution customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing political regimes in executive, legislative and/or judicial branches of government, that may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products

•Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility

Cross-border transactions. We switch substantially all cross-border transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related to switched transactions. Revenue from switching cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. Cross-border activity has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health, weather and other conditions. These include or have included: 

•Global pandemics (and related post-pandemic global economic impacts) and potential separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics) 

•Current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts to our business

•The threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change) 

The impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity. Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our cross-border activity (for example, the targets announced by the G20 Financial Stability Board related to cross-border payments). In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive. 

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the cross-border impacts described above, our compliance with sanctions and our decision to suspend our business operations in Russia has led, and could further lead, to other legal ramifications and operational challenges, including fines, the nationalization of our subsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.

Standards. Our operations as a global payments network rely in part on global interoperable standards to help facilitate payments. To the extent geopolitical events or government intervention result in jurisdictions no longer participating in the creation or adoption of these standards, or the creation of competing standards, our products and services could be negatively impacted.

Any of these developments potentially could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations.

During 2024, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the U.S., which could be transacted in a non-functional currency. Impacts from currency fluctuations are included in our net income. Our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies. 

In addition, the revenue we generate in entities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations, including where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected. 

Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion into U.S. dollars of our other revenue currencies and financial assets.

The occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Brand, Reputational Impact and Environmental, Social and Governance

Negative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business.

Our brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry:

•Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory”. Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers or other companies and organizations that use our products and services (including certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco) may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater public, regulatory or legislative scrutiny, as well as potential litigation. We may also face similar scrutiny to the extent that we are unable to detect and/or prevent illegal activities using our payment products or otherwise occurring over our network. 

•Under some circumstances, our use of social media, or the use of social media by others as a channel for criticism or other purposes, could also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brands by disseminating rapidly and globally actual or perceived damaging information about us, our products or merchants or other end users who utilize our products. 

•We are headquartered in the U.S. As such, a negative perception of the U.S. could impact the perception of our company, which could adversely affect our business. 

Any of the above issues could have a material and adverse effect on our overall business.

Lack of visibility of our brand in our products and services, or in the products and services of our partners who use our technology, may materially and adversely affect our business. 

As more players enter the global payments ecosystem, the layers between our brand and consumers and merchants increase. We often partner with other consumer brands on payment solutions, including large digital companies and other technology companies who are our customers and use our networks to build their own acceptance brands. In some cases, our brand may not be featured in the payment solution or may be secondary to other brands. Additionally, as part of our relationships with some issuers, our payment brand is only included on the back of the card. As a result, our brand may either be invisible to consumers or may not be the primary brand with which consumers associate the payment experience. This brand invisibility, or any consumer confusion as to our role in the consumer payment experience, could decrease the value of our brand, which could adversely affect our business. 

Environmental, social and governance matters and related stakeholder reaction may impact our reputation, increase legal exposure and/or have other business impacts, which could adversely affect our overall business and/or results of operations. 

Our brand and reputation are associated with the ways in which we impact environmental, social and governance matters. These matters include initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help everyone participate equitably in the digital economy and create a workplace that provides equal opportunities for all of our employees. Consumers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on these impacts. To the extent any of our disclosures, public statements and metrics about these matters are subsequently viewed as inaccurate, or we are unable to execute on these initiatives, we may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Moreover, in recent years, we have received negative feedback from stakeholders on the adequacy of our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We have also increasingly been receiving negative feedback from anti-environmental, social and governance stakeholders in opposition to such initiatives. Stakeholders from both 

36 MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

sides of this issue may continue to view us negatively and take public action against us to the extent that we do not satisfy their conflicting views or expectations.

In addition, various jurisdictions are increasingly adopting or considering laws, regulations and oversight expectations that have or would impact us pertaining to environmental, social and governance matters, including required corporate reporting and disclosures. These requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased compliance costs for our business and supply chain, which may increase our operating costs. 

Moreover, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressure to address climate change and other environmental, social and governance matters, these stakeholders may express new expectations and focus investments in ways that could cause significant shifts in commerce and consumption behaviors. The impact of and uncertainty that could result from such shifts could ultimately impact our business. 

Any of the above issues could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations.

Talent and Culture

We may not be able to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce, or maintain our corporate culture, which could harm our overall business and results of operations.

Our performance largely depends on the skills, capabilities and motivation of our employees (including our people leaders), as well as the environment we create for them to enable them to perform their jobs effectively. The market for specialized skill-sets remains highly competitive, particularly in technology and other areas that are important to the growth of our business. To the extent we are unable to differentiate our value proposition in the market, effectively develop leaders and build robust succession pipelines, it could impact our ability to deliver for our customers. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified employee talent could leave us vulnerable to not anticipating or identifying emerging customer or market opportunities. In addition, escalations in global conflict and a rise in mental health needs are also impacting the well-being of our people. To the extent we are unable to communicate effectively on these issues and provide support to our employees, we could experience a significant impact on our business, reputation and culture. Further, changes in and enforcement of immigration and work permit laws and visa regulations have made it difficult for employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions where we operate, potentially impairing our ability to attract and retain talent. We also face increasing regulation with respect to new pay and benefits transparency requirements, which could subject us to liability or reputational harm if we do not adhere to these requirements in a timely manner.

As our workforce composition continues to change, our employees may have different expectations with respect to flexibility and well-being support, and may have different career motivations (such as pursuing project-based work or other gig opportunities, as opposed to linear career paths). Additionally, employees may require different levels of support as to re-skilling and upskilling in order to adapt to advancements in our industry and changes in technology. Further, certain current and prospective employees may have expectations as to positions we take on environmental, social and governance matters. To the extent we are unable to effectively meet and/or balance these different expectations, motivations and needs, we could experience a negative impact to the quality of our corporate culture, the productivity of our workforce, our ability to innovate and our ability to attract and retain talent. 

We rely on our people leaders to display integrity and decency, as role models for the Mastercard Way. To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that is not consistent with these values, we could experience significant impact to our brand and reputation, as well as to our corporate culture.

Any one or more of the above could harm our overall business and results of operations. 

Acquisitions and Strategic Investments

Our efforts to enter into acquisitions, strategic investments or new businesses could be impacted or prevented by regulatory scrutiny and could otherwise result in issues that could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations or reputation.

We continue to evaluate our strategic acquisitions of, and investments in, complementary businesses, products or technologies. As we do so, we face increasing regulatory scrutiny with respect to antitrust, national security and other considerations that could impact these efforts. We also face competition for acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies. As a result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such acquisitions in the future. If we are not successful in these efforts, we could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic growth. 

To the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original intentions and focused efforts. Such an integration also may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. Moreover, we have spent, and may continue to spend, time and money on acquisitions or projects that do

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

not sufficiently meet our expectations (either strategically or financially), which has resulted (and may in the future result) in divesting from or otherwise exiting these investments or businesses. Additionally, to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves available to us for other uses, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, we have inherited and may in the future inherit litigation risk which has or may increase our post-acquisition costs of operations and/or impact our ability to successfully finance that business.

Any acquisition, investment or entry into a new business could subject us to new regulations or legal requirements, both directly as a result of the new business as well as in the other existing parts of our business, with which we would need to comply. This compliance could increase our costs, and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we cannot meet any such compliance requirements. Additionally, targets that we acquire have had, and may in the future have, data practices that do not initially conform to our privacy, data protection and information security standards and data governance model, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. These targets also have resulted in, and may in the future lead to, information security vulnerabilities for us. 

Settlement and Third-Party Obligations

Our role as guarantor, as well as other contractual obligations and discretionary actions, expose us to risk of loss or illiquidity.

We are a guarantor of certain third-party obligations, including those of certain of our customers and service providers. In this capacity, we are exposed to credit and liquidity risks. We may incur significant losses in connection with transaction settlements if a customer fails to fund its daily settlement obligations due to technical problems, liquidity shortfalls, insolvency or other reasons. The occurrence of bank failures, such as those seen in recent years in the U.S., could increase the potential for such losses. Concurrent settlement failures of more than one of our larger customers or of several smaller customers either on a given day or over a condensed period of time may exceed our available resources. In addition, as we are subject to increased regulation across the globe, jurisdictions could require us to extend our guarantee to additional obligations, which could have an impact on our cost of operations.

Certain non-guaranteed transactions, as well as chargebacks to acquirers in the event of acquirer default, could result in elevated brand risk and the potential for financial loss. 

We have significant contractual indemnification obligations with certain customers, which could be triggered depending on the circumstances.

Any of the above issues or events could have a material or adverse impact to our overall business and/or results of operations.

Class A Common Stock and Governance Structure

Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions and have an impact on change-in-control.

Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could be considered anti-takeover provisions, including provisions that could delay or prevent entirely a merger or acquisition that our stockholders consider favorable. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or have the effect of delaying or preventing entirely a change in control, which could harm our stock price. For example, subject to limited exceptions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from beneficially owning more than 15% of any of the Class A common stock or any other class or series of our stock with general voting power, or more than 15% of our total voting power. In addition:

•our stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors

•our stockholders are not entitled to act by written consent

•any representative of a Mastercard or Mastercard Foundation competitor is disqualified from service on our board of directors

Mastercard Foundation’s substantial stock ownership, and restrictions on its sales, may impact corporate actions or acquisition proposals favorable to, or favored by, the other public stockholders.

As of December 31, 2024, Mastercard Foundation owned shares of Class A common stock representing approximately 9.4% of our general voting power. Historically, Mastercard Foundation had been restricted from selling or otherwise transferring its shares of Class A common stock prior to May 1, 2027, except to the extent necessary to satisfy its charitable disbursement requirements, for which purpose earlier sales were permitted and had occurred. In July 2023, pursuant to an application in consultation with Mastercard, Mastercard Foundation received court approval to advance that date to January 1, 2024. As a result, Mastercard Foundation is now permitted to sell all or part of its remaining shares, subject to certain conditions. In March 2024, Mastercard Foundation began selling shares pursuant to an orderly and structured plan to diversify its Mastercard shares over a seven-year

period, while committing to remain a long-term Mastercard stockholder and retaining a significant holding of Mastercard shares in its portfolio. The directors of Mastercard Foundation are required to be independent of us and our customers. The ownership of Class A common stock by Mastercard Foundation, together with the seven-year diversification plan, could discourage or make more difficult acquisition proposals favored by other holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, because Mastercard Foundation intends to sell its shares over an extended period of time, it may not have the same interest in short or medium-term movements in our stock price as, or incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable to, our other stockholders. 

Item 1B. Unresolved staff comments

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity program 

As a technology company in the global payments industry entrusted with the safeguarding of sensitive information (including personal information), cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program. A robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats is critical to managing risk effectively. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise resilience program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. We work with experts across the organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of cyber and physical threats, including threats and incidents associated with the use of services provided by third-party providers. Our cybersecurity program provides (among other things) a framework for handling cybersecurity threats and incidents, which includes steps for identifying the nature of a cybersecurity threat (including whether the threat is associated with a third-party provider), assessing the severity of a cybersecurity threat (including advancing to key members of management where appropriate for determination of potential materiality) and implementing cybersecurity processes and procedures.

Program highlights

•We are committed to the responsible handling of personal information, and we balance our product development activities with a commitment to transparency and control, fairness and non-discrimination, as well as accountability

•Our multi-layered privacy, data protection and information security programs and practices are designed to ensure the safety, security and responsible use of the information and data our stakeholders entrust to us

•We work with our customers, governments, policymakers and others to help develop and implement standards for safe and secure transactions, as well as privacy-centric data practices

•Our programs are informed by third-party assessments and advice regarding best practices from consultants, peer companies and advisors

•Our programs are designed to align with internationally recognized privacy, data protection and information security standards and undergo regular certifications and attestations

•We continually test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities

•We have processes for evaluating (among other things) the privacy, data protection and information security infrastructure of our third-party providers (including examining any relevant records), and we seek to manage third-party risk with procedures to onboard our third-party providers, monitor their activity during our engagement (where possible) and off-board such third-party service providers at the end of our engagement

•We maintain a business continuity program and cyber insurance coverage

Governance and oversight of privacy, data protection and information security 

Board and Committee responsibilities

Our Board and Risk Committee have specific oversight responsibilities with respect to cybersecurity and privacy risk:

MASTERCARD 2024 FORM 10-K 39

PART I

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY

•Board: Understanding the issues and risks that are central to the company’s success, including cybersecurity matters

•Risk Committee: Overseeing risks relating to our policies, procedures and strategic approach to information security (inclusive of cybersecurity), privacy and data protection, among other things 

In general, the Audit Committee and Risk Committee coordinate to oversee our guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and our Audit Committee discusses our financial and operational risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. In this context, the Audit Committee would be informed of a material cybersecurity incident that could have a potential impact on our financial statements.

Management responsibilities

We have a core group of senior executives who are responsible for assessing and managing risk and implementing policies, procedures and strategies pertaining to security governance, data protection and privacy. These executives include:

•Chief Security Officer (CSO), who develops and oversees the programs, policies and controls we have implemented across the organization to reduce and prevent logical and physical risks, including information security and cyber risks to our people, intellectual property, data and tangible property 

•Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer, who establishes and oversees the programs, policies, processes and controls we have implemented across the organization to ensure compliance with worldwide laws and regulations regarding how we collect, use, share, store, transfer and otherwise process data and utilize AI, while also managing our relevant engagements with regulators, policymakers and key stakeholders

•Chief Data Officer, who establishes and oversees our efforts to maintain an ethical, responsible enterprise data program that adheres to our high standards for data quality, curation and governance while minimizing data risks

•Data Protection Officer, who reports to the Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer and, with the support of the Global Data Protection Office, ensures that we continue to adhere to the GDPR and local privacy requirements, including by handling privacy requests from individuals and regulators

In order to be appointed to one of the roles described above, we require expertise with cybersecurity or data privacy (as applicable), as demonstrated by prior work or other cybersecurity or data privacy experience or possession of a cybersecurity or data privacy degree or certification. Each individual currently serving in these roles meets the applicable expertise requirements.

How management is informed of and monitors incidents

Our management is responsible for identifying, considering and assessing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes to ensure that such potential cybersecurity risks are monitored, implementing appropriate mitigation measures and maintaining our cybersecurity programs. Our cybersecurity programs are under the direction of our CSO (in coordination with our Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer and Chief Data Officer, among others), who receives reports from our cybersecurity teams and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our management, including the CSO and our cybersecurity teams, follow a risk-based escalation process to notify the Risk Committee outside of the regular reporting cycle as appropriate when they identify an emerging risk or material issue.

Reporting to our Board

Given the importance of information security and privacy to our stakeholders, our Board receives an annual report from our CSO to discuss our program for managing information security risks, including cyber and data security risks. The Risk Committee also receives periodic briefings on data privacy from the Chief Privacy and Data Responsibility Officer. Our Risk Committee receives regular reports on our cyber readiness, our risk profile status, our cybersecurity programs, material cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies, third-party assessments of our cybersecurity program and other cybersecurity developments. The Risk Committee Chairperson provides reports to the Board on such topics. Our Board and the Risk Committee also receive information about these topics as part of regular business and legal and regulatory updates. In addition, we engage directors as part of cybersecurity and data breach incident simulations. Further, the Audit Committee would be informed of a material cybersecurity incident that could have a potential impact on our financial statements.

Despite our efforts to identify and respond to cybersecurity threats, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. See “Risk Factors – Information Security and Operational Resilience” in Part I, Item 1A for more information about these and other risks related to information security.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUES PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Item 5. Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities

Our Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MA”. At February 7, 2025, we had 67 stockholders of record for our Class A common stock. We believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our Class A common stock is held in “street name” by brokers.

There is currently no established public trading market for our Class B common stock. There were approximately 214 holders of record of our non-voting Class B common stock as of February 7, 2025, constituting approximately 0.7% of our total outstanding equity. 

Stock Performance Graph

The graph and table below compare the cumulative total stockholder return of Mastercard’s Class A common stock, the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Financials for the five-year period ended December 31, 2024. The graph assumes a $100 investment in our Class A common stock and both of the indices and the reinvestment of dividends. Mastercard’s Class B common stock is not publicly traded or listed on any exchange or dealer quotation system.

Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (together, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Business Overview 

Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions. These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data. Our capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.

Mastercard is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers (the account holders’ financial institutions), or establish the rates charged by acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions) in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.

Additionally, a change in our geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rate compared to the prior year.

Non-GAAP Financial Information 

Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). As described more fully below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition, as well as the related tax impacts. Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”). We also present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:

Gains and Losses on Equity Investments

•During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $29 million ($25 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share), $61 million ($36 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) and $145 million ($126 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share), respectively. These net losses were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.

Special Items

Litigation provisions 

•During 2024, we recorded pre-tax charges of $680 million ($495 million after tax, or $0.53 per diluted share), primarily as a result of a legal provision associated with the U.K. consumer class action settlement, settlements with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation. 

•During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $539 million ($376 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted share), primarily as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation and settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.

•During 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after tax, or $0.27 per diluted share), primarily as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.

Restructuring charge

•During 2024, we recorded a restructuring charge of $190 million ($147 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share). The restructuring action is intended to streamline our organization, delivering efficiencies to enable reinvestment in our business to support the realization of our long-term growth opportunities.

Russia-related impacts

•During 2022, we recorded a net pre-tax charge of $30 million ($24 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), directly related to imposed sanctions and the suspension of our business operations in Russia. The net charge was comprised of general and administrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible balances with certain sanctioned customers. This charge was offset by net benefits of $37 million in net revenue, primarily related to a reduction in payment network rebates and incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer performance for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business operations in Russia. 

See Note 7 (Investments) and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion related to certain of the items discussed above.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Currency-neutral Growth Rates

Currency-neutral growth rates are calculated by remeasuring the prior period’s results using the current period’s exchange rates for both the translational and transactional impacts on operating results and are non-GAAP financial measures. The impact of currency translation represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different from our U.S. dollar reporting currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expenses occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. The impact of the related realized gains and losses resulting from our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments (specifically those that manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses) is recognized in the respective financial statement line item on the statements of operations when the underlying forecasted transactions impact earnings.

The translational and transactional impact of currency and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments as specified in the preceding paragraph (collectively the “Currency Impact”) has been excluded from our currency-neutral growth rates and has been identified in the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” tables below and our “Drivers of Change” tables. See “Foreign Currency - Currency Impact” for further information on our currency impacts and “Financial Results - Net Revenue” and “Financial Results - Operating Expenses” for our “Drivers of Change” tables.

Key Metrics and Drivers

In addition to the financial measures described above in “Financial Results Overview”, we review the following metrics to evaluate and identify trends in our business, measure our performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe that the key metrics presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. 

Operating Margin measures how much profit we make on each dollar of sales after our operating costs but before other income (expense) and income tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.

Key Drivers 

Gross Dollar Volume (“GDV”)1 measures dollar volume of activity, including both domestic and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; “purchase volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and “cash volume” means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and includes the impact of balance transfers and convenience checks obtained with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter. We report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change.

Cross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.

Key Metrics related to the Payment Network

Assessments represent agreed upon standard pricing provided to our customers based on various forms of payment-related activity. Assessments are used internally by management to monitor operating performance as it allows for comparability and provides visibility into cardholder trends. Assessments do not represent our net revenue.

The following provides additional information on our key metrics related to the payment network:

•Domestic assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same. These assessments are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of activity (e.g., domestic purchase volume, domestic cash volume) or the number of cards issued.

•Cross-border assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are different. These assessments are primarily driven by the cross-border dollar volume of activity (e.g., cross-border purchase volume, cross-border cash volume). 

•Transaction processing assessments are charges primarily driven by the number of switched transactions on our payment network. Switching activities include:

◦Authorization, the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval 

◦Clearing, the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction 

◦Settlement, which facilitates the determination and exchange of funds between parties

These assessments can also include connectivity services and network access, which are based on the volume of data transmitted and the number of authorization and settlement messages.

•Other network assessments are charges for licensing, implementation and other franchise fees.

Foreign Currency

Currency Impact

Our primary functional currencies are the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and the Brazilian real. Our overall operating results are impacted by currency translation, which represents the effect of translating operating results where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. 

Our operating results are also impacted by transactional currency. The impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transactions occurring in a currency other than the functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”), which is used in the calculation of our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives. GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars and euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our key metrics related to domestic assessments and cross-border assessments as well as certain volume-related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro versus local currencies. For example, our billing in Australia is in the U.S. dollar, however, consumer spend in Australia is in the Australian dollar. The transactional currency impact of converting Australian dollars to our U.S. dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar is evident when GDV growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis is compared to GDV growth on a local currency basis. In 2024, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 8.1%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 10.5% versus 2023. In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.6%, while GDV on a local currency basis increased 12.2% versus 2022. Further, the impact from transactional currency occurs in our key metrics related to transaction processing assessments and other network assessments as well as value-added services and solutions revenue and operating expenses when the transacting currency of these items is different than the functional currency of the entity.

To manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship as discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Foreign Exchange Activity

We incur foreign currency gains and losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, including settlement assets and obligations, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. To manage this foreign exchange risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of our nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these contracts are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The impact of this foreign exchange activity, including with the related hedging activities, has not been eliminated in our currency-neutral results.

Our foreign exchange risk management activities are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Net revenue increased 12%, or 13% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year. The increase in net revenue was attributable to growth in our payment network and value-added services and solutions. 

Net revenue from our payment network increased 10%, or 11% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in domestic and cross-border dollar volumes and an increase in the number of switched transactions, reflecting growth trends across all of our key drivers. Net revenue from our payment network includes $17,629 million of rebates and incentives provided to customers, which increased 16%, or 18% on a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our key drivers as well as new and renewed deals.

Net revenue from our value-added services and solutions increased 17%, on both an as-reported and currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by (1) growth in our underlying key drivers, (2) our consumer acquisition and engagement and business and market insight services, (3) our security and digital and authentication solutions and (4) pricing.

No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of net revenue in any such period. A significant portion of our net revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2024, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $6.3 billion, or 22%, of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue.

Advertising and marketing expenses decreased 1%, on both an as-reported and a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year. 

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 12%, on both an as-reported and a currency-neutral basis, in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to increased software capitalization driven by the continued growth of and investment in our business. 

Provision for Litigation

In 2024, we recorded charges of $680 million, primarily as a result of a legal provision associated with the U.K. consumer class action settlement, settlements with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation. In 2023, we recorded charges of $539 million, primarily as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation and settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants. In 2022, we recorded charges of $356 million, primarily as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 15.6% and 17.9%, respectively. The adjusted effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 16.2% and 18.5%, respectively. Both the as-reported and as-adjusted effective income tax rates were lower in 2024, primarily due to a discrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset. In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022 changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”) released by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Therefore, we recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. This discrete tax expense was partially offset by our ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice. Additionally, a change in our geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rates compared to the prior year. 

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar 2 guidelines published to date include transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax (the “Pillar 2 Rules”). In 2024, we did not experience a material impact as a result of Pillar 2 Rules. However, in 2025, we expect the Pillar 2 Rules will primarily offset the reduction to our effective income tax rate resulting from our incentive grant received from the Singapore Ministry of Finance. For the year ended December 31, 2024, this incentive grant reduced our effective income tax rate by approximately 4%. We are continuously monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts these new rules may have on our future effective income tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. 

See Note 20 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, investments and credit available to us at December 31:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | 2024| | 2023  
| | (in billions)  
Cash, cash equivalents and investments 1| | $| 8.8 | | | $| 9.2 |   
Unused line of credit| | $| 8.0 | | | $| 8.0 |   

1Investments include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. This amount excludes restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, our cash flow generating capabilities, and our access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy our future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations and potential obligations which include litigation provisions and credit and settlement exposure.

Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our customers. Historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be indicative of potential future losses. The risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven by regional or global economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region. See Note 22 (Settlement and Other Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 for a description of these guarantees.

Our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. For additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business, see Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors - Legal and Regulatory Risks and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Cash Flows

The table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | For the Years Ended December 31,  
| | 2024| | 2023| | 2022

Net cash used in financing activities| | $| (10,836)| | | $| (9,488)| | | $| (10,328)|   

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.8 billion in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items, an increase in billing collections, and less cash paid for litigation settlement, partially offset by a decrease in restricted security deposits received from customers.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $2.1 billion in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to cash paid for business acquisitions in the current year, partially offset by a net decrease in purchases of investments in time deposits.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $1.3 billion in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock, dividends, and repayments of debt, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds received from debt issuances.

Debt and Credit Availability

In April 2024, $1 billion of principal related to the 2014 USD Notes matured and was paid. In July 2024, INR28.1 billion ($336 million as of payment date) of principal related to the 2023 INR Term Loan matured and was paid.

During 2024, we issued a total of $4 billion of debt, as follows:

•In May 2024, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due May 2034

•In September 2024, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due January 2028, $1,150 million principal amount of notes due January 2032 and $1,100 million principal amount of notes due January 2035

The issuances in 2024 are collectively referred to as the “2024 USD Notes”. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 USD Notes, after deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $3.96 billion.

Our total debt outstanding was $18.2 billion at December 31, 2024, with the earliest maturity of $750 million of principal occurring in March 2025.

As of December 31, 2024, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires in November 2029. 

Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers. In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes. We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2024.

See Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.

Dividends and Share Repurchases

We have historically paid quarterly dividends on our outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs.

Cash dividends paid| | $| 2,448 | | | $| 2,158 | | | $| 1,903 |   

On December 17, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share paid on February 7, 2025 to holders of record as of January 9, 2025 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend was $694 million.

On February 10, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share payable on May 9, 2025 to holders of record as of April 9, 2025 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount of this dividend is estimated to be $693 million.

Repurchased shares of our common stock are considered treasury stock. In December 2024 and 2023, our Board of Directors approved share repurchase programs of our Class A common stock authorizing us to repurchase up to $12.0 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. The program approved in 2024 will become effective after the completion of the program approved in 2023. The timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including cash requirements to meet the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, as well as the share price and economic and market conditions. The following table summarizes our share repurchase authorizations and repurchase activity of our Class A common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024, unless otherwise noted:

Critical Accounting Estimates

The application of GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. 

Revenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives

We enter into business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives when customers meet certain volume thresholds or other incentives tied to customer performance. We consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer. Rebates and incentives are recorded within net revenue based on these estimates primarily when volume- and transaction- based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Differences between actual results and our estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 

Income Taxes

In calculating our effective income tax rate, estimates are required regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. Through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all sources of taxable income, including projected future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. If it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.

We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and, if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would generally increase earnings in the period. In certain situations, we will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions. 

Business Combinations

We account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition purchase price, including contingent consideration, if any, is allocated to the underlying identified, tangible and intangible assets, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. The amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisition-related tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense. We use various valuation techniques to determine fair value, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings for estimating the value of intangible assets. These valuation techniques include comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the expected useful lives, requires management’s judgment. The significance of management’s estimates and assumptions is relative to the size of the acquisition. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in factors such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is limited. Management monitors risk exposures on an ongoing basis and establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. 

Foreign currency and interest rate exposures are managed through our risk management activities, which are discussed further in Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. 

Foreign Exchange Risk

We enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements occurring in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. We may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value of assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations. The objective of these activities is to reduce our exposure to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies could result in a fair value loss of approximately $475 million and $414 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity. 

We are also subject to foreign exchange risk as part of our daily settlement activities. To manage this risk, we enter into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with our customers. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the functional currencies would not have a material impact to the fair value of our short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We are further exposed to foreign exchange rate risk related to translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is different than our U.S. dollar reporting currency. To manage this risk, we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. The effect of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar could result in a fair value loss of approximately $279 million on our foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge at December 31, 2024, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity. As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any foreign exchange derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge.

Interest Rate Risk

Our available-for-sale debt investments include fixed and variable rate securities that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair value of our investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 

We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate debt. To manage this risk, we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our fixed-rate debt that is exposed to changes in fair value attributable to changes in a benchmark interest rate. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse change in interest rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately $20 million and $29 million on the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts designated as a fair value hedge of our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, before considering the offsetting effect of the underlying hedged activity.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of Mastercard Incorporated (“Mastercard”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has assessed the effectiveness of Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management has concluded that, based on its assessment, Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the next page. Management’s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. (“Recorded Future”), which was acquired in December 2024. Recorded Future is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment of internal controls represented approximately 1% and less than 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mastercard Incorporated

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mastercard Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management has excluded RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 1% and less than 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Rebates and Incentives

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides certain customers with rebates and incentives which are a portion of total net revenue of $28.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives within net revenue that could be either fixed or variable. Variable rebates and incentives are recorded primarily when volume- and transaction-based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Variable rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer performance, such as volume thresholds, and the terms of the related business agreements. As disclosed by management, various factors are considered in estimating customer performance, including forecasted transactions, card issuance and card conversion volumes, expected payments and historical experience with that customer.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to rebates and incentives is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing estimates related to rebates and incentives based on customer performance; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s estimates related to customer performance, including the reasonableness of the various applicable factors considered by management in the estimate.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to rebates and incentives, including controls over evaluating estimated customer performance. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of estimated customer performance for a sample of customer agreements, including (i) evaluating the agreements to identify whether all rebates and incentives are identified and recorded accurately; (ii) testing management’s process for developing estimated customer performance, including evaluating the reasonableness of the various applicable factors considered by management; and (iii) evaluating estimated customer performance as compared to actual results in the period the customer reports actual performance.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Organization

Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry. Mastercard connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible. The Company makes payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using its family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. The Company operates a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and Mastercard customers. Through its unique and proprietary global payments network, the Company switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions. The Company has additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, the Company offers consumer and commercial payment products, captures new payment flows and provides services and solutions. The Company’s services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on Mastercard’s principled and responsible use of secure data. The Company’s capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For the global payments network, Mastercard’s franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which it operates.

Mastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of the Company’s products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company’s financial institution customers.

Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and basis of presentation \- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as marketable, equity method or measurement alternative method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no significant VIEs that required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2024 presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported net revenue, operating income or net income. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Non-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, net income/(losses) attributable to non-controlling interests were not material and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense).

Use of estimates \- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. These financial statements were prepared using information reasonably available as of December 31, 2024 and through the date of this Report. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue recognition \- Revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue from the Company’s payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other market participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as well as by charging fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDV, which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry the Company’s brands. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the related transactions and volume occur. Certain volume-based revenue is determined from information reported by customers.

Revenue from the Company’s value-added services and solutions is generated through either fixed or transaction-based fees. These services and solutions can be integrated and sold with the Company’s payment network services or can be sold on a stand-alone basis. For those contracts that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). The SSP is the price at which the Company would sell a promised product or service separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. Revenue from the Company’s value-added services and solutions is recognized in the period in which the related services and solutions are performed or transactions occur. For services provided to customers where delivery involves the use of a third-party, the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis if it acts as the principal, controlling the service to the customer, or on a net basis if it acts as the agent, arranging for the service to be provided. 

Mastercard has business agreements with certain customers that provide for rebates and incentives within net revenue that could be either fixed or variable. Fixed incentives typically represent payments to a customer directly related to entering into an agreement, which are generally capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement on a straight-line basis. Capitalized customer incentives are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Variable rebates and incentives are recorded primarily when volume- and transaction-based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. Variable rebates and incentives are calculated based upon estimated customer performance, such as volume thresholds, and the terms of the related business agreements. Customer incentives to be paid to customers under business agreements are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Certain of the Company’s contracts may include options to receive additional value-added services and solutions. The Company accounts for the option as a distinct performance obligation if the option provides a material right to the customer. Material rights are incremental to the standard offerings, which a customer would not have received without entering into the contract. If a material right exists in a contract, revenue allocated to the option is deferred and recognized as revenue when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires. The value of the option is based on observable prices in the contract or on a relative SSP basis. 

Contract assets include unbilled consideration typically resulting from executed value-added services and solutions performed for customers in connection with Mastercard’s payments network service arrangements. Collection for these services typically occurs over the contractual term. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company defers the recognition of revenue when consideration has been received prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations. As these performance obligations are satisfied, revenue is subsequently recognized. Deferred revenue primarily relates to certain value-added services and solutions. Deferred revenue is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Business combinations \- The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The Company measures the tangible and intangible identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. Measurement period adjustments, if any, to the preliminary estimated fair value of the intangibles assets as of the acquisition date are recorded in goodwill.

Goodwill and other intangible assets \- Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of goodwill and customer relationships. Goodwill represents the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date and the assembled workforce. Finite-lived intangible assets consist of capitalized software costs, intangible assets acquired in business combinations (including customer relationships and acquired technology) and other intangible assets. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis, which range from one to twenty years. Capitalized software includes internal and external costs incurred directly related to the design, development and testing phases of each capitalized software project.

The valuation methods for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations involve assumptions concerning comparable company multiples, discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The Company uses various valuation techniques to determine the fair value of its intangible assets, primarily discounted cash flows analysis, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets are based on

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified in Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy (as defined in Fair value subsection below). 

Impairment of assets \- Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter, or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. The impairment evaluation for goodwill utilizes a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. The qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, operating environment, financial performance and other relevant events. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, then the Company is required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge. 

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, then a quantitative assessment is required. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the carrying value, the asset is not impaired. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the asset is impaired and the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment charge.

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded.

Impairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

Litigation \- The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies are recorded in provision for litigation on the consolidated statements of operations. These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of its defenses and consultation with in-house and external legal counsel. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

Settlement and other risk management \- Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the payment network transactions between its customers. Settlement exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. For those transactions the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the settlement obligation to the extent the settlement obligation is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.

The Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company. As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable. 

The Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at its fair value at the inception or modification date through earnings.

Settlement assets/obligations \- The Company operates systems for settling payment transactions among participants in the payments ecosystem in which the Company operates. Settlement is generally completed on a same-day basis. In some circumstances, however, funds may not settle until subsequent business days. In addition, the Company may receive or post funds in advance of transactions related to certain payments capabilities. The Company classifies the balances arising from these various activities as settlement assets and settlement obligations.

Income taxes \- The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are displayed separately as noncurrent assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Valuation allowances are provided against assets which are not more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes all material tax positions, including uncertain tax positions in which it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits and if challenged by the relevant taxing authorities. At each balance sheet date, unresolved uncertain tax positions are reassessed to determine whether subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax benefit. The allowance for uncertain tax positions is recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company

records interest expense related to income tax matters as interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company includes penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.

Cash and cash equivalents \- Cash and cash equivalents include certain investments with daily liquidity and with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents \- The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as restricted when it is unavailable for withdrawal or use in its general operations. The Company has the following types of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (“restricted cash”) that are included in the reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows:

•Restricted cash \- Restricted cash includes cash segregated to meet regulatory commitments, cash within qualified legal settlement funds and cash restricted for other general business purposes, including contractually restricted deposits as well as cash balances that are restricted based on the Company’s intention with regard to usage. 

•Restricted security deposits held for customers \- The Company requires certain customers to enter into risk mitigation arrangements, including cash collateral and/or forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees, for settlement of their transactions. Certain risk mitigation arrangements for settlement, such as standby letters of credit and bank guarantees, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also holds cash deposits and certificates of deposit from certain customers as collateral for settlement of their transactions, which are recorded as assets on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are fully offset by corresponding liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of these security deposits and the duration held are determined by the risk profile of the individual customer and the Company’s risk management practices.

Fair value \- The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis by estimating the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company also measures certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, when a change in fair value or impairment is evidenced. The Company classifies these recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements into a three-level hierarchy (“Valuation Hierarchy”).

The Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument’s categorization within the Valuation Hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the Valuation Hierarchy are as follows: 

•Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in inactive markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability.

•Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and cannot be directly corroborated by observable market data.

The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include investment securities available-for-sale, marketable securities, derivative instruments and deferred compensation. The Company’s financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include nonmarketable securities. The Company’s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include property, equipment and right-of-use assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.

Investment securities \- The Company classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at the date of acquisition.

•Available-for-sale debt securities:

◦Investments in debt securities that are available to meet the Company’s current operational needs are classified as current assets and the securities that are not available for current operational needs are classified as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

The debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of changes in equity. Net realized gains and losses on debt securities are recognized in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses.

The Company evaluates its debt securities for impairment on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes an impairment if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component of the impairment is recognized as an allowance and recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

operations while the non-credit related loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized from a sale or subsequent impairment. 

•Held-to-maturity securities: 

◦Time deposits - The Company classifies time deposits with original maturities greater than three months as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities that mature within one year are classified as current assets within investments on the consolidated balance sheets while held-to-maturity securities with maturities of greater than one year are classified as other assets. Time deposits are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets and are intended to be held until maturity.

Equity investments - The Company holds equity securities of publicly traded and privately held companies.

•Marketable equity securities - Marketable equity securities are strategic investments in publicly traded companies and are measured at fair value using quoted prices in their respective active markets with changes recorded through gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Marketable equity securities that are expected to be held as part of the Company’s long-term investment strategy are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

•Nonmarketable equity investments - The Company’s nonmarketable equity investments, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include strategic investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value of its nonmarketable equity investments when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company’s nonmarketable equity investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method or equity method.

◦Measurement alternative method - The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the measurement alternative method of accounting when it does not exercise significant influence, generally when it holds less than 20% ownership in the entity or when the interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company is less than 5% and the Company has no significant influence over the operations of the investee. Investments in companies that Mastercard does not control, but that are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also accounted for under the measurement alternative method of accounting. Measurement alternative investments are measured at cost, less any impairment and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Fair value adjustments, as well as impairments, are included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

◦Equity method - The Company accounts for investments in common stock or in-substance common stock under the equity method of accounting when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee, generally when it holds between 20% and 50% ownership in the entity. The excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments accounted for under the equity method is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on fair values at the date of acquisition. The amortization of the excess of the cost over the underlying net equity of investments and Mastercard’s share of net earnings or losses of entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting is included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. 

In addition, investments in flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies are also accounted for under the equity method when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee, generally when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 5% of the outstanding ownership interest. The Company’s share of net earnings or losses for these investments are included in gains (losses) on equity investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative and hedging instruments \- The Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. The Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate derivative contracts are included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair value of the contracts are based on inputs that are observable based on broker quotes for the same or similar instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses from the change in fair value of the derivatives are recognized in current earnings. 

The Company’s derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments are required to meet established accounting criteria. In addition, an effectiveness assessment is required to demonstrate that the derivative is expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposure both at inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. The method of assessing hedge effectiveness and measuring hedge results is formally documented at hedge inception and assessed at least quarterly throughout the designated hedge period.

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company may designate derivative instruments as cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges, as follows:

•Cash flow hedges - Fair value adjustments to derivative instruments are recorded, net of tax, in other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Any gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are subsequently reclassified to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statements of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. For hedges that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and any gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. Any amounts excluded from effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the associated gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statements of operations in current earnings.

•Fair value hedges - Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability (“hedged item”) that is attributable to the hedged risk. All amounts recognized in earnings are recorded to the corresponding line item on the consolidated statements of operations as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Hedged items are measured on the consolidated balance sheets at their carrying amount adjusted for any changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk (“basis adjustments”). The Company defers the amortization of any basis adjustments until the end of the derivative instrument’s term. If the hedge designation is discontinued for reasons other than derecognition of the hedged item, the remaining basis adjustments are amortized in accordance with applicable GAAP for the hedged item. 

•Net investment hedges - The Company has numerous investments in foreign subsidiaries. The net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The effective portion of the foreign currency gains and losses related to the hedging instruments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets as a cumulative translation adjustment component of equity. Gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings only if the Company sells or substantially liquidates its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the net investment hedge each quarter.

Property, equipment and right-of-use assets \- Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation of leasehold improvements and amortization of finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Operating lease amortization expense is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company determines if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. The Company’s right-of-use (“ROU”) assets are primarily related to operating leases for office space, automobiles and other equipment. Leases are included in property, equipment and right-of-use assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In addition, ROU assets include initial direct costs incurred by the lessee as well as any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, and exclude lease incentives. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined by using the rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments for a similar term and in a similar economic environment. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of one year or less are excluded from ROU assets and liabilities. 

The Company excludes variable lease payments in measuring ROU assets and lease liabilities, other than those that depend on an index, a rate or are in-substance fixed payments. Lease and nonlease components are generally accounted for separately. When available, consideration is allocated to the separate lease and nonlease components in a lease contract on a relative standalone price basis using observable standalone prices.

Pension and other postretirement plans \- The Company recognizes the funded status of its single-employer defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans as assets or liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date.

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Overfunded plans, if any, are aggregated and recorded in other assets, while underfunded plans are aggregated and recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost/(income), excluding the service cost component, is recognized in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. These costs include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs or credits and gains or losses previously recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The service cost component is recognized in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

Defined contribution plans \- The Company’s contributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as employees render service to the Company. The charge is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

Advertising and marketing \- Expenses incurred to promote Mastercard’s brand, products and services are recognized in advertising and marketing on the consolidated statements of operations. The timing of recognition is dependent on the type of advertising or marketing expense.

Foreign currency remeasurement and translation \- Revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than applicable functional currency of an entity are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates. Resulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Treasury stock \- The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction. These shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders’ equity. Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares. The Company also records an excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of net repurchases of shares of its common stock within treasury stock.

Share-based payments \- The Company measures share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and uses the straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for expensing awards over the requisite employee service period. The Company estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards (“Options”) using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company’s stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine the grant date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted. All share-based compensation expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

Redeemable non-controlling interests \- The Company’s business combinations may include provisions allowing non-controlling equity owners the ability to require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at their discretion. The interests are initially recorded at fair value and in subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated redemption value. The adjustments to the redemption value are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. The redeemable non-controlling interests are considered temporary and reported outside of permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling interest’s share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.

Earnings per share \- The Company calculates basic earnings per share (“EPS”) by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of stock options and unvested stock units using the treasury stock method. The Company may be required to calculate EPS using the two-class method as a result of its redeemable non-controlling interests. If redemption value exceeds the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests, the excess would be a reduction to net income for the EPS calculation.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures \- In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance includes improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025.

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses \- In November 2024, the FASB issued accounting guidance to improve the disclosures of a public business entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods after December 15, 2027. The Company is in the process of evaluating when it will adopt this guidance.

Note 2. Acquisitions 

In 2024, the Company acquired businesses for total cash consideration of $2.8 billion. In December 2024, Mastercard acquired a 100% equity interest in RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. (“Recorded Future”), a global threat intelligence company, for cash consideration of $2.7 billion. This acquisition is expected to add threat intelligence capabilities to Mastercard’s identity, fraud prevention, real-time decisioning and cybersecurity services. The net assets acquired primarily relate to intangible assets, including goodwill of $1.7 billion that is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes.

In 2023, the Company did not complete any material business acquisitions.

In 2022, Mastercard acquired a 100% equity interest in Dynamic Yield LTD (“Dynamic Yield”) for cash consideration of $325 million. The net assets acquired primarily relate to intangible assets, including goodwill of $200 million that is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition date. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for local tax purposes. 

These acquisitions align with the Company’s strategy to grow, diversify and build the Company’s business. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) for the valuation techniques Mastercard utilizes to fair value the respective components of business combinations. 

The Company is evaluating and finalizing the purchase accounting for the businesses acquired during 2024. In 2023, the Company finalized the purchase accounting for the business acquired during 2022. The fair values of the purchase price allocations in aggregate, as of the acquisition dates, are noted below for the years ended December 31.

Note 3. Revenue 

Mastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from a wide range of payments solutions provided to customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services (i.e., fees charged to customers). The Company disaggregates its net revenue from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions. The Company’s net revenue categories, payment network and value-added services and solutions, are recognized net of rebates and incentives provided to customers. Rebates and incentives can be either fixed or variable and are attributed to the category of revenue to which they pertain. 

Payment network

Mastercard’s payment network involves four participants in addition to the Company: account holders (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuers (the account holders’ financial institutions), merchants and acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions). Revenue from the Company’s payment network is primarily generated by charging fees to customers (issuers, acquirers and other market participants) for providing switching and other network-related services, as well as by charging fees to customers based primarily on the gross dollar volume of activity (GDV, which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry the Company’s brands. As a payments network service provider, the Company provides its customers with continuous access to its global payments network and stands ready to provide transaction processing over the contractual term. Consideration is variable and is recognized as revenue in the period in which volumes and transactions occur. 

Value-added services and solutions

The Company generates revenues from value-added services and solutions through either fixed or transaction-based fees. These services and solutions can be integrated and sold with the Company’s payment network services or can be sold on a stand-alone basis. These services and solutions primarily include security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, business and market insights, digital and authentication solutions, processing and gateway, ACH batch and real-time account-based payments and solutions, and open banking. Revenue from these services and solutions is recognized in the period in which the related services and solutions are performed or transactions occur.

The Company’s customers are generally billed weekly, with certain billings occurring on a monthly and quarterly basis. The frequency of billing is dependent upon the nature of the performance obligation and the underlying contractual terms. The Company does not typically offer extended payment terms to customers.

1 Revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in 2024 was $2.8 billion. 

2 During 2024, the increase in deferred revenue is primarily driven by the acquisition of Recorded Future.

The Company’s remaining performance periods for its contracts with customers for its payments network services are typically long-term in nature (generally up to 10 years). As a payments network service provider, the Company provides its customers with continuous access to its global payments network and stands ready to provide transaction processing and related services over the contractual term. Consideration is variable as the Company generates volume- and transaction-based revenues from charging fees on its customers’ current period activity. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to its payments network services. The Company also earns revenue from value-added services and solutions. At December 31, 2024, the estimated aggregate consideration allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for these services and solutions is $1.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized through 2029. The estimated remaining performance obligations related to these revenues are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including modifications and terminations and are not expected to be material to any future annual period.

Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents| | $| 10,808 | | | $| 10,465 | | | | |   

1During 2024, the Company increased its Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents balance primarily as a result of cash segregated to meet regulatory commitments, as the Company is subject to systemic importance regulation in the European Union. The increase was also attributable to restricted cash for litigation within a qualified settlement fund related to the settlement agreement for the ATM non-discrimination rule surcharge complaints. See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) for additional information.

Note 7. Investments 

The Company’s investments on the consolidated balance sheets include both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities (see Investments section below). The Company’s strategic investments in equity securities of publicly traded and privately held companies are classified within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets (see Equity Investments section below).

Investments 

Investments on the consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following at December 31: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | 2024| | 2023

Held-to-maturity securities 1| | 38 | | | 306 |   
Total investments | | $| 330 | | | $| 592 |   

1Held-to-maturity securities represent investments in time deposits that mature within one year. The cost of these securities approximates fair value.

Investment income on the consolidated statements of operations primarily consists of interest income generated from cash, cash equivalents, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investment securities, as well as realized gains and losses on the Company’s investment securities. The realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.

Available-for-Sale Securities 

The major classes of the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and their respective amortized cost basis and fair values at December 31 were as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Total| | $| 291 | | | $| 1 | | | $| — | | | $| 292 | | | $| 286 | | | $| 1 | | | $| (1)| | | $| 286 |   

The Company’s government and agency securities include U.S. government bonds, U.S. government sponsored agency bonds and foreign government bonds that are denominated in the national currency of the issuing country. Corporate securities held at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and asset-backed securities held at December 31, 2024, primarily carried a credit rating of A- or better. Corporate securities are comprised of commercial paper and corporate bonds. The gross unrealized gains and losses on the available-for-sale securities are primarily driven by changes in interest rates. For the available-for-sale securities in gross unrealized loss positions, the Company (1) does not intend to sell the securities, (2) more likely than not, will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the unrealized losses and (3) expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated statements of changes in equity.

The maturity distribution based on the contractual terms of the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities at December 31, 2024 was as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Amortized  
Cost| | Fair Value

Equity Investments

Included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets are equity investments with readily determinable fair values (“Marketable securities”) and equity investments without readily determinable fair values (“Nonmarketable securities”). Marketable securities are equity interests in publicly traded companies and are measured using unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets. Nonmarketable securities that do not qualify for equity method accounting are measured at cost, less any impairment and adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investments of the same issuer (“Measurement alternative”). 

The following table is a summary of the activity related to the Company’s equity investments:

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements 

The Company’s financial instruments are carried at fair value, cost or amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company classifies its fair value measurements of financial instruments into a three-level hierarchy (the “Valuation Hierarchy”).

Financial Instruments - Carried at Fair Value

Financial instruments carried at fair value are categorized for fair value measurement purposes as recurring or non-recurring in nature.

Recurring Measurements

The distribution of the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the Valuation Hierarchy was as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

1The Company’s U.S. government securities are classified within Level 1 of the Valuation Hierarchy as the fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in active markets. The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate and asset-backed securities are based on observable inputs such as quoted prices, benchmark yields and issuer spreads for similar assets in active markets and are therefore included in Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy.

2The Company’s foreign exchange and interest rate derivative asset and liability contracts measured at fair value are based on observable inputs such as broker quotes for similar derivative instruments. See Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for further details. 

3The Company’s Marketable securities are publicly held and fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in their respective active markets.

4The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation plan where assets are invested primarily in mutual funds held in a rabbi trust, which is restricted for payments to participants of the plan. The Company has elected to use the fair value option for these mutual funds, which are measured using quoted prices of identical instruments in active markets and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 

5The deferred compensation liabilities are measured at fair value based on the quoted prices of identical instruments to the investment vehicles selected by the participants. These are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nonrecurring Measurements

Nonmarketable Securities

The Company’s Nonmarketable securities are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods after initial recognition under the equity method or measurement alternative method. Nonmarketable securities are classified within Level 3 of the Valuation Hierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value that require management’s judgment. The Company uses discounted cash flows and market assumptions to estimate the fair value of its Nonmarketable securities when certain events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. See Note 7 (Investments) for further details. 

Financial Instruments - Not Carried at Fair Value

Debt

Debt instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at amortized cost. The Company estimates the fair value of its debt based on either market quotes or observable market data. Debt is classified as Level 2 of the Valuation Hierarchy as it is generally not traded in active markets. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $18.2 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of debt was $15.7 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively. See Note 15 (Debt) for further details.

Other Financial Instruments

Certain other financial instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost or amortized cost basis, which approximates fair value due to their short-term, highly liquid nature. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, accounts receivable, settlement assets, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents, accounts payable, settlement obligations and other accrued liabilities.

1Includes technology acquired in business combinations.

The increase in the gross carrying amount of finite-lived intangible assets in 2024 was primarily related to the acquisition of Recorded Future in 2024 as well as software additions to support the continued growth of the Company. Certain intangible assets are denominated in foreign currencies. As such, the change in intangible assets includes a component attributable to foreign currency translation. Based on the qualitative assessment performed in 2024, it was determined that the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.

Amortization on the finite-lived intangible assets above amounted to $523 million, $457 million and $414 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

1During 2024, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the depreciation of the euro, Brazilian real, and British pound against the U.S. dollar. During 2023, the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss related to foreign currency translation adjustments was driven primarily by the appreciation of the euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar. 

2During 2024, the increase in the accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedges was driven by the depreciation of the euro and British pound against the U.S. dollar. During 2023, the decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income related to the net investment hedges was driven by the appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. See Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.

3Certain foreign exchange derivative contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. See Note 23 (Derivative and Hedging Instruments) for additional information.

Note 18. Share-Based Payments 

In May 2006, the Company granted the following awards under the Mastercard Incorporated 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan, which was amended and restated as of June 22, 2021 (the “LTIP”). The LTIP is a stockholder-approved plan that permits the grant of various types of equity awards to employees. The Company has granted Options, RSUs and PSUs under the LTIP. The Company uses the straight-line method of attribution for expensing all equity awards. Compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures, with estimates adjusted as appropriate.

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

There are approximately 116 million shares of Class A common stock authorized for equity awards under the LTIP. Although the LTIP permits the issuance of shares of Class B common stock, no such shares have been authorized for issuance. Shares issued as a result of Option exercises and the conversions of RSUs and PSUs were funded primarily with the issuance of new shares of Class A common stock.

Stock Options

Options expire ten years from the date of grant and vest ratably over three years for awards granted on or after March 1, 2022. For awards granted before March 1, 2022, they vest ratably over four years. For Options granted, a participant’s unvested awards are forfeited upon termination; however, in the event a participant terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven months after receiving the award, the participant retains all of their awards without providing additional service to the Company. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and years of service. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period as stated in the LTIP. 

The fair value of each Option is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation and the resulting weighted-average fair value per Option granted for the years ended December 31:

As of December 31, 2024, there was $16 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested Options. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Restricted Stock Units 

For RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2022, the awards generally vest ratably over three years. For RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2020 but before March 1, 2022, the awards generally vest ratably over four years. A participant’s unvested awards are forfeited upon termination of employment; however, in the event of termination due to job elimination (as defined by the Company), a participant will retain a pro-rata portion of the unvested awards for services performed through the date of termination. In the event a participant terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven months after receiving the award, the participant retains all of their awards without providing additional service to the Company. Compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the vesting periods stated in the LTIP or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire but not less than seven months.

The following table summarizes the Company’s RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

RSUs expected to vest at December 31, 2024| | 2.0 | | | $| 403 | | | $| 1,034 |   

The fair value of each RSU is the closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange of the Company’s Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents. Upon vesting, a portion of the RSU award may be withheld to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding taxes. The remaining RSUs will be settled in shares of the Company’s Class A common stock after the vesting period. As of December 31, 2024, there was $378 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.

Performance Stock Units

PSUs vest after three years and are subject to a mandatory one-year post-vest hold, during which they are eligible for dividend equivalents. A participant’s unvested awards are forfeited upon termination of employment; however, in the event of termination due to job elimination (as defined by the Company), a participant will retain a pro-rata portion of the unvested awards for services performed through the date of termination. In the event a participant terminates employment due to disability or retirement more than seven months after receiving the award, the participant retains all of their awards without providing additional service to the Company.

The following table summarizes the Company’s PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:

PSUs expected to vest at December 31, 2024| | 0.6 | | | $| 396 | | | $| 321 |   

Since 2013, PSUs containing performance and market conditions have been issued. Performance measures used to determine the actual number of shares that vest after three years include net revenue growth, EPS growth and relative total shareholder return (“TSR”). Relative TSR is considered a market condition, while net revenue and EPS growth are considered performance conditions. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine the grant-date fair value. 

Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the requisite service period, or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire but not less than seven months, if it is probable that the performance target will be achieved and subsequently adjusted if the probability assessment changes. As of December 31, 2024, there was $37 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.

Note: Table may not sum due to rounding.

The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were 15.6%, 17.9% and 15.4%, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2024 was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2023, primarily due to a discrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset. In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022 changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”). Therefore, the Company recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. This discrete tax expense was partially offset by the Company’s ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice. Additionally, a change in the Company’s geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rate compared to the prior year. 

The effective income tax rate for 2023 was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2022, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits. In 2022, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $333 million to release the valuation allowance resulting from U.S. tax regulations published in the first quarter of 2022 (the “2022 Regulations”). In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the 2022 Regulations changed due to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice released by Treasury. Therefore, the Company recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. The discrete tax expense recognized in 2023 was partially offset by the Company’s ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice.

Singapore Income Tax Rate 

In connection with the expansion of the Company’s operations in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, the Company’s subsidiary in Singapore, Mastercard Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. (“MAPPL”) received an incentive grant from the Singapore Ministry of Finance in 2010. The incentive had provided MAPPL with, among other benefits, a reduced income tax rate for the 10-year period commencing January 1, 2010 on taxable income in excess of a base amount. The Company continued to explore business opportunities in this region, resulting in an expansion of the incentives being granted by the Ministry of Finance, including a further reduction to the income tax rate on taxable income in excess of a revised fixed base amount commencing July 1, 2011 and continuing through December 31, 2025. Without the incentive grant, MAPPL would have been subject to the statutory income tax rate on its earnings. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the impact of the incentive grant received from the Ministry of Finance resulted in a reduction of MAPPL’s income tax liability of $644 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, $571 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, and $454 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, respectively.

Indefinite Reinvestment 

As of December 31, 2024 the Company does not accrue taxes on $3.8 billion of foreign earnings that remain permanently reinvested outside the U.S. The Company expects that taxes associated with any future repatriation of these earnings are immaterial. 

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows:

1The 2022 activity resulted in a full release of the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward due to final U.S. tax regulations published in 2022. The 2023 activity resulted in the establishment of the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward due to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice released by Treasury.

2Capital losses are included within other items in the deferred tax assets section of the components of the Deferred Income Taxes table above.

The recognition of foreign tax credits is dependent upon the realization of future foreign source income in the appropriate foreign tax credit basket in accordance with U.S. federal income tax law. The recognition of the net operating and capital losses is dependent on the timing and character of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a foreign tax credit carryforward and tax effected net operating loss carryforwards of $736 million and $468 million, respectively. The foreign tax credits begin to expire in 2029 and the majority of the net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. 

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, is as follows:

1Includes immaterial translational impact of currency.

As of December 31, 2024, the amount of unrecognized tax benefit was $304 million. This amount, if recognized, would reduce income tax expense by $246 million. In 2024, the decrease in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due to the withdrawal of a prior year refund claim, which had no impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

The Company is subject to tax in the United States, Belgium, Singapore, the United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions, as well as state and local jurisdictions. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted after considering facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. Within the next twelve months, the Company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. While such a change may be significant, it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statutes of limitation expire. The Company has effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2014. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to state and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014.

Note 21. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 

Mastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and therefore, Mastercard has not established liabilities for any of these proceedings, except as discussed below. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, Mastercard records a liability and discloses the amount of the liability if it is material. When a material loss contingency is only reasonably possible, Mastercard does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Unless otherwise stated below with respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of the following reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of monetary damages or the amounts are unsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, (5) the proceedings involve multiple defendants or potential defendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel legal issues presented. Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below, Mastercard does not believe that the outcome of any individual existing legal or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and overall business. However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to any proceedings discussed below could result in fines or payments by Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its business practices. In addition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the filing of civil damage claims and possibly result in significant damage awards. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Mastercard’s results of operations, financial condition and overall business.

Interchange Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings 

Mastercard’s interchange fees and other practices are subject to regulatory, legal review and/or challenges in a number of jurisdictions, including the proceedings described below. When taken as a whole, the resulting decisions, regulations and legislation with respect to interchange fees and acceptance practices may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s prospects for future growth and its overall results of operations and financial condition.

United States. In 2005, the first of a series of complaints were filed on behalf of merchants (the majority of the complaints were styled as class actions, although a few complaints were filed on behalf of individual merchant plaintiffs) against Mastercard International, Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions. Taken together, the claims in the complaints were generally brought under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibit monopolization and attempts or conspiracies to monopolize a particular industry, and some of these complaints contain unfair competition law claims under state law. The complaints allege, among other things, that Mastercard, Visa, and certain financial institutions conspired to set the price of interchange fees, enacted point-of-sale acceptance rules (including the “no surcharge” rule) in violation of antitrust laws and engaged in unlawful tying and bundling of certain products and services, resulting in merchants paying excessive costs for the acceptance of Mastercard and Visa credit and debit cards. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in MDL No. 1720 (the “U.S. MDL Litigation Cases”). The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint seeking treble damages.

In 2006, the group of purported merchant class plaintiffs filed a supplemental complaint alleging that Mastercard’s initial public offering of its Class A Common Stock in May 2006 (the “IPO”) and certain purported agreements entered into between Mastercard and financial institutions in connection with the IPO: (1) violate U.S. antitrust laws and (2) constituted a fraudulent conveyance because the financial institutions allegedly attempted to release, without adequate consideration, Mastercard’s right to assess them for Mastercard’s litigation liabilities. The class plaintiffs sought treble damages and injunctive relief including, but not limited to, an order reversing and unwinding the IPO.

In 2011, Mastercard and Mastercard International entered into each of: (1) an omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement with Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. Inc. and Visa International Service Association and a number of financial institutions; and (2) a Mastercard settlement and judgment sharing agreement with a number of financial institutions. The agreements provide for the apportionment of certain costs and liabilities which Mastercard, the Visa parties and the financial institutions may incur, jointly and/or severally, in the event of an adverse judgment or settlement of one or all of the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases. Among a number of scenarios addressed by the agreements, in the event of a global settlement involving the Visa parties, the financial institutions and Mastercard, Mastercard would pay 12% of the monetary portion of the settlement. In the event of a settlement involving only Mastercard and the financial institutions with respect to their issuance of Mastercard cards, Mastercard would pay 36% of the monetary portion of such settlement. 

In 2012, the parties entered into a definitive settlement agreement with respect to the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases (including with respect to the claims related to the IPO) and the defendants separately entered into a settlement agreement with the individual

merchant plaintiffs. The settlements included cash payments that were apportioned among the defendants pursuant to the omnibus judgment sharing and settlement sharing agreement described above. Mastercard also agreed to provide class members with a short-term reduction in default credit interchange rates and to modify certain of its business practices, including its no surcharge rule. The court granted final approval of the settlement in 2013. Following an appeal by objectors and as a result of a reversal of the settlement approval by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the case was sent back to the district court for further proceedings. The court divided the merchants’ claims into two separate classes - monetary damages claims (the “Damages Class”) and claims seeking changes to business practices (the “Rules Relief Class”). The court appointed separate counsel for each class. 

In 2018, the parties to the Damages Class litigation entered into a class settlement agreement to resolve the Damages Class claims, with merchants representing slightly more than 25% of the Damages Class interchange volume choosing to opt out of the settlement. The Damages Class settlement agreement became final in August 2023. Since 2018, Mastercard has reached settlements or agreements in principle to settle with over 250 opt-out merchants. These opt-out merchant settlements, along with the Damages Class settlement, represent over 90% of Mastercard’s U.S. interchange volume.

Approximately 65 individual opt-out merchants continue to litigate, seeking treble damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. During the first quarter of 2024, the district court denied the defendants’ motions for summary judgment with respect to these ongoing individual opt-out merchant cases, sending the cases back to their original jurisdictions for trials. In October 2024, the remaining opt-out merchants submitted expert reports on liability and damages issues. The aggregate single damages claimed by these merchants total approximately $12 billion with respect to their Mastercard purchase volume. Mastercard would be responsible for 36% of any Mastercard-related judgment pursuant to the December 2011 judgment and settlement sharing agreement discussed above. The first trial in the opt-out merchant cases, which will involve six of the larger opt-out merchants, has been scheduled for October 2025.

In 2021, the district court granted the Rules Relief Class’s motion for class certification. In March 2024, the parties to the Rules Relief Class litigation entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the Rules Relief Class claims. The court held a preliminary settlement approval hearing in June 2024, and subsequently issued a decision denying approval of the settlement. The parties are in ongoing settlement discussions. The court has not yet scheduled a trial date.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mastercard had accrued a liability of $559 million and $596 million, respectively, for the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases. The liability as of December 31, 2024 represents Mastercard’s best estimate of its probable liabilities in these matters and does not represent an estimate of a loss, if any, if the matters were litigated to a final outcome. Mastercard cannot estimate the potential liability if that were to occur.

Europe. Since 2012, a number of United Kingdom (“U.K.”) merchants filed claims or threatened litigation against Mastercard seeking damages for excessive costs paid for acceptance of Mastercard credit and debit cards arising out of alleged anti-competitive conduct with respect to, among other things, Mastercard’s cross-border interchange fees and its U.K. and Ireland domestic interchange fees (the “U.K. Merchant claimants”). In addition, Mastercard has faced similar filed or threatened litigation by merchants with respect to interchange rates in other countries in Europe (the “Pan-European Merchant claimants”). Mastercard has resolved a substantial amount of these damages claims through settlement or judgment. Following these settlements, approximately £0.3 billion (approximately $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2024) of unresolved damages claims remain. Mastercard continues to litigate with the remaining U.K. and Pan-European Merchant claimants and it has submitted statements of defense disputing liability and damages claims. A number of those matters are now progressing with motion practice and discovery. A hearing involving multiple merchant cases was completed in March 2024 concerning certain liability issues with respect to merchant claims for damages related to post-Interchange Fee Regulation consumer interchange fees as well as commercial and inter-regional interchange fees.

In a separate matter, Mastercard and Visa were served with a proposed collective action complaint in the U.K. on behalf of merchants seeking damages for commercial card transactions in both the U.K. and the European Union. In December 2023, the plaintiffs filed a revised collective action application claiming damages against Mastercard in excess of £1 billion (approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024). In June 2024, the court granted the plaintiffs’ collective action application. Mastercard’s request for permission to appeal this ruling was denied.

In 2016, a proposed collective action was filed in the United Kingdom on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages for intra-European Economic Area (“EEA”) and domestic U.K. interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by merchants between 1992 and 2008. The complaint, which seeks to leverage the European Commission’s 2007 decision on intra-EEA interchange fees, claims damages in an amount that exceeds £10 billion (approximately $13 billion as of December 31, 2024). In 2021, the trial court issued a decision in which it granted class certification to the plaintiffs but narrowed the scope of the class. Since January 2023, the trial court has held hearings on various issues, including whether any causal connection existed between the levels of Mastercard’s intra-EEA interchange fees and U.K. domestic interchange fees and regarding Mastercard’s request to narrow the number of years of damages sought by the plaintiffs on statute of limitations grounds. In February 2024, the trial court ruled in

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Mastercard’s favor, finding no causal connection between the levels of Mastercard’s intra-EEA interchange fees and U.K. domestic interchange fees. In June 2024, the trial court ruled in Mastercard’s favor with respect to its request to dismiss five years of the plaintiffs’ damages claims on statute of limitations grounds. The plaintiffs’ request for permission to appeal this ruling was granted. In December 2024, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve this matter. The parties have submitted supporting papers to the court seeking approval of the settlement, and the court has scheduled a hearing on settlement approval for late February 2025. Mastercard recorded an accrual of £200 million ($251 million as of December 31, 2024) in connection with this settlement agreement.

Mastercard has been named as a defendant in a proposed consumer collective action filed in Portugal on behalf of Portuguese consumers. The complaint, which seeks to leverage the 2019 resolution of the European Commission’s investigation of Mastercard’s central acquiring rules and interregional interchange fees, claims damages of approximately €0.4 billion (approximately $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2024) for interchange fees that were allegedly passed on to consumers by Portuguese merchants for a period of approximately 20 years. Mastercard has submitted a statement of defense that disputes both liability and damages. 

Australia. In 2022, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (“ACCC”) filed a complaint targeting certain agreements entered into by Mastercard and certain Australian merchants related to Mastercard’s debit program. The ACCC alleges that by entering into such agreements, Mastercard engaged in conduct with the purpose of substantially lessening competition in the supply of debit card acceptance services. The ACCC seeks both declaratory relief and monetary fines and costs. A hearing on liability issues has been scheduled for March 2025. 

ATM Non-Discrimination Rule Surcharge Complaints 

In 2011, a trade association of independent ATM operators and 13 independent ATM operators filed a complaint styled as a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against both Mastercard and Visa (the “ATM Operators Class Complaint”). Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of non-bank operators of ATM terminals that operate in the United States with the discretion to determine the price of the ATM access fee for the terminals they operate. Plaintiffs allege that Mastercard and Visa have violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by imposing rules that require ATM operators to charge non-discriminatory ATM surcharges for transactions processed over Mastercard’s and Visa’s respective networks that are not greater than the surcharge for transactions over other networks accepted at the same ATM. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. 

Subsequently, multiple related complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging both federal antitrust and multiple state unfair competition, consumer protection and common law claims against Mastercard and Visa on behalf of different putative classes of users of ATM services. The claims in these actions largely mirror the allegations made in the ATM Operators Class Complaint, although these complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services who pay allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank (“Bank ATM Consumer Class Complaint”) and non-bank (“Non-bank ATM Consumer Class Complaint”) ATM operators as a result of the defendants’ ATM rules. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees. 

In 2019, the plaintiffs in all three class complaints filed with the district court their motions for class certification. In 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court affirmed the district court’s previous order granting class certification. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the defendants’ appeal of the certification decision. 

In May 2024, Mastercard executed a settlement agreement with the class lawyers representing the Bank ATM Consumer Class, subject to court approval. At a hearing held in January 2025, the court indicated that it intends to provide final approval of the settlement. During the first quarter of 2024, Mastercard recorded an accrual of $93 million in connection with this matter. The litigation with the ATM Operators Class and Non-bank ATM Consumer Class is ongoing. The plaintiffs in these two remaining class complaints, in aggregate, allege over $1 billion in single damages against all of the defendants.

U.S. Liability Shift Litigation

In 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the “Network Defendants”), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks (the “Bank Defendants”) engaged in a conspiracy to shift fraud liability for card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in compliance with the standards for EMV chip cards in the United States (the “EMV Liability Shift”), in violation of the Sherman Act and California law. Plaintiffs allege damages equal to the value of all chargebacks for which class members became liable as a result of the EMV Liability Shift on October 1, 2015. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, attorney’s fees and costs and an injunction against future violations of governing law. The district court denied the Network Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants. In 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases described above. In 2020, the district court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification. The plaintiffs have submitted expert reports that allege aggregate single damages in excess of $1 billion against the four Network Defendants. The Network Defendants submitted expert reports rebutting both liability and damages and all briefs on summary judgment have been submitted. In September 2024, the district court denied the Network Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.

Telephone Consumer Protection Class Action

Mastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action pending in Florida. The plaintiffs are individuals and businesses who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them advertising a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank (“FAB”). The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ request for class certification, but narrowed the scope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard’s request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plaintiffs’ motion to amend the class definition and Mastercard’s cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023 and the parties await the court’s decision.

U.S. Department of Justice Investigation

In March 2023, Mastercard received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DOJ”) seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. The CID focuses on Mastercard’s U.S. debit program and competition with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.

European Commission Investigation 

In August 2024, Mastercard received a formal request for information from the European Commission seeking documents and information in connection with an investigation into alleged anti-competitive behavior of certain card scheme services in the European Union/EEA. The request focuses on Mastercard’s practices regarding network fees related to acquirers. Mastercard is cooperating with the European Commission in connection with the request.

Note 22. Settlement and Other Risk Management 

Mastercard’s rules guarantee the settlement of many of the payment network transactions between its customers (“settlement risk”). Settlement exposure is the settlement risk to customers under Mastercard’s rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. For those transactions the Company guarantees, the guarantee will cover the full amount of the settlement obligation to the extent the settlement obligation is not otherwise satisfied. The duration of the settlement exposure is short-term and generally limited to a few days.

Gross settlement exposure is estimated using the average daily payment volume during the three months prior to period end multiplied by the estimated number of days of exposure. The Company has global risk management policies and procedures, which include risk standards, to provide a framework for managing the Company’s settlement risk and exposure. In the event of failed settlement by a customer, Mastercard may pursue one or more remedies available under the Company’s rules to recover potential losses. Historically, the Company has experienced a low level of losses from customer settlement failures. 

As part of its policies, Mastercard requires certain customers that do not meet the Company’s risk standards to enter into risk mitigation arrangements, including cash collateral and/or forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees. This requirement is based on a review of the individual risk circumstances for each customer. Mastercard monitors its credit risk portfolio and the adequacy of its risk mitigation arrangements on a regular basis. Additionally, the Company periodically reviews its risk management methodology and standards. As such, the amounts of estimated settlement exposure are revised as necessary.

Mastercard also provides guarantees to customers and certain other counterparties indemnifying them from losses stemming from failures of third parties to perform duties. This includes guarantees of Mastercard-branded travelers cheques issued, but not yet cashed. In addition, the Company enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions with the Company. Certain indemnifications do not provide a stated maximum exposure. As the extent of the Company’s obligations under these agreements depends entirely upon the occurrence of future events, the Company’s potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable. Historically, payments made by the Company under these types of contractual arrangements have not been material.

Note 23. Derivative and Hedging Instruments 

The Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate exposures as part of its overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. A primary objective of the Company’s risk management strategies is to reduce the financial impact that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses both foreign exchange derivative contracts (when the hedge costs are economically justified) and foreign currency denominated debt to manage its currency exposure. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts, including forwards and options, to manage the impact of foreign currency variability on anticipated revenues and expenses, which fluctuate based on currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The objective of these hedging activities is to reduce the effect of movement in foreign exchange rates for a portion of revenues and expenses forecasted to occur. As these contracts are designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations when the underlying hedged transactions impact earnings. The terms of these contracts are for generally less than 18 months.

In April 2024, the Company entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign denominated assets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged transactions impact earnings. Forward points are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are amortized to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations over the hedge period. The maximum term of these contracts was for approximately 7 years.

In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company’s aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances, and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified as an adjustment to interest expense over the respective terms of the hedged debt issuances.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate debt and designate such derivatives as hedging instruments in a fair value hedging relationship. Changes in fair value of these contracts and changes in fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in the hedged benchmark interest rate generally offset each other and are recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses related to the net settlements of interest rate swaps are also recorded in interest

expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The periodic cash settlements are included in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

In 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to $1.0 billion of the 3.850% Senior Notes due March 2050. In effect, the interest rate swap synthetically converts the fixed interest rate on this debt to a variable interest rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) Overnight Index Swap Rate. The net impact to interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not material. 

Net Investment Hedges

The Company may use foreign currency denominated debt and/or foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign subsidiaries against adverse movements in exchange rates. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded as a currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Forward points are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are amortized to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations over the hedge period. The amounts recognized in earnings related to forward points for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material. 

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had €1.3 billion and €1.6 billion euro-denominated debt outstanding designated as hedges of a portion of its net investment in its European operations. In December 2024 and 2023, the Company de-designated €400 million and €109 million of the euro-denominated debt as net investment hedges to effectively manage changes in its net investment exposures in foreign subsidiaries. The €109 million of euro-denominated debt de-designated in December 2023 was subsequently re-designated as a net investment hedge effective April 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company recorded pre-tax net foreign currency gains (losses) of $104 million, $(67) million and $176 million, respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss). 

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net foreign currency gains of $295 million and $181 million, after tax, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with this hedging activity. 

Non-designated Derivatives 

The Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to serve as economic hedges, such as to offset possible changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange fluctuations, without designating these derivative contracts as hedging instruments. In addition, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk as part of its daily settlement activities. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with customers. To manage this risk, the Company may enter into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position. The objective of these activities is to reduce the Company’s exposure to volatility arising from gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments and the related notional amounts:

The Company’s derivative financial instruments are subject to both market and counterparty credit risk. Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other related variables. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of loss due to failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations in accordance with contractual terms. The Company’s derivative contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements, which contain various netting and setoff provisions. However, the Company has elected to present derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into derivative contracts with a diversified group of selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. Generally, the Company does not obtain collateral related to derivatives because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties.

Note 24. Segment Reporting 

Mastercard has concluded it has one reportable operating segment, “Payment Solutions.” The Payment Solutions segment derives its revenues from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers. Revenue is generated from offering customers access to Mastercard’s continuous payment network, as well as by providing value-added services and solutions, whether integrated and sold with the payment network or on a stand-alone basis. Revenue is recognized when services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services (i.e., fees charged to customers). All of the segment’s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent upon and supportive of the other. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of Mastercard at the consolidated level. The accounting policies of the Payment Solutions segment are the same as those described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).

Mastercard’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”). The CODM assesses performance for the Payment Solutions segment and decides how to allocate resources, including whether to reinvest profits into the Payment Solutions segment or into other business activities such as for acquisitions, to pay dividends or for share repurchases, based on net income as reported on the consolidated statements of operations (“Consolidated Net Income”). The CODM uses
