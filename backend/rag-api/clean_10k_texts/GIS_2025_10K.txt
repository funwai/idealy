ITEM 1 - Business

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

For more than

150 years, General

Mills has been

making food the

world loves. 

We 

are a leading

global manufacturer and

marketer of 

branded consumer

foods with more

than 100 brands

in 100 countries

across six continents.

In addition to

our consolidated operations, 

we

have

50

percent

interests

in

two

strategic

joint

ventures

that

manufacture

and

market

food

products

sold

in

approximately

130 

countries worldwide. 

We 

manage and review the financial results of our

business under four operating segments: North America Retail; International;

North 

America

Pet;

and

North

America

Foodservice.

See

Management’s

Discussion

and

Analysis

of

Financial

Condition

and

Results

of 

Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments. 

We 

offer a variety of human and pet food

products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and

value for consumers around the 

world. Our business is focused on the following large, global

categories: 

●

snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and

frozen hot snacks; 

●

ready-to-eat cereal; 

●

convenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes,

frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees; 

●

wholesome natural pet food;

refrigerated and frozen dough; 

●

baking mixes and ingredients; 

●

yogurt; and 

●

super-premium ice cream. 

Our Cereal Partners Worldwide

(CPW) joint venture with Nestlé

S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the

ready-to-eat cereal category in markets 

outside North

America, and

our Häagen-Dazs

Japan, Inc.

(HDJ) joint

venture

competes in

the super-premium

ice cream

category

in 

Japan. For net sales contributed

by each class of similar

products, please see Note 17

to the Consolidated Financial

Statements in Item 

8 of this report. 

The terms

“General Mills,”

“Company,”

“registrant,” “we,”

“us,” and

“our” mean

General Mills, Inc.

and all

subsidiaries included

in 

the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context

indicates otherwise. 

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of

this report. 

Customers 

Our

primary

customers

are

grocery

stores,

mass

merchandisers,

membership

stores,

natural

food

chains,

drug,

dollar

and

discount 

chains, e-commerce

retailers, commercial

foodservice distributors

and operators,

restaurants, convenience

We

generally

our

direct

sales

force.

We

use

broker

distribution 

arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types

of customers and certain markets. For further information

Competition 

The

human

and

pet

food

categories

are

highly

competitive,

with

numerous

manufacturers

of

varying

sizes in

the

United

States and 

throughout the

world. The categories

in which

we participate

also are

very competitive.

Our principal

competitors in

these categories 

are manufacturers, as

well as retailers with

their own branded

products. Competitors market

and sell their products

through brick-and-

mortar stores

and e-commerce.

All our

principal competitors

have substantial

financial, marketing,

and other

resources. Competition 

in

our

product

categories

is

based

on

product

innovation,

product

quality,

price,

brand

recognition

and

loyalty,

effectiveness

of 

marketing,

promotional

activity,

convenient

ordering

and

delivery

to

the consumer,

and the

ability

to

identify

and

satisfy

consumer 

preferences.

Our

principal

strategies

for

competing

in

each

of

our

segments

include

unique

consumer

insights,

effective

customer 

relationships, superior

product quality,

innovative advertising,

product promotion,

product innovation

aligned with consumers’

needs, 

an efficient

supply chain, and

price. In most

product categories, we

compete not only

with other widely

advertised, branded

products, 

but also

with regional

brands and

with generic

and private

label products

that are

generally sold

at lower

prices. Internationally,

we 

compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each

country includes a unique group of competitors. 

5 

Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging 

The

principal

raw

materials

that

we

use

are

grains

(wheat,

oats,

and

corn),

dairy

products,

meat,

vegetable

oils,

sugar,

vegetables, 

fruits,

nuts,

and

other

agricultural

products.

We

also

use

substantial

quantities

of

carton

board,

corrugated,

plastic,

and

metal 

packaging

materials,

operating

supplies,

and

energy.

Most

of

these

inputs

for

our

domestic

and

Canadian

operations

are

purchased 

from suppliers

in the

United States. In

our other

international operations,

inputs that

are not locally

available in

adequate supply

may 

be imported

from other

countries. The

cost of

these inputs

may fluctuate

widely due

to external

conditions such

as weather,

climate 

change,

product

scarcity,

limited

sources

of

supply,

commodity

market

fluctuations,

currency

fluctuations,

trade

tariffs,

pandemics, 

war,

and

changes

in

governmental

agricultural

and

energy

policies

and

regulations.

We

believe

that

we

will

be

able

to

obtain

an 

adequate supply

of needed

inputs. Occasionally

and where

possible, we

make advance

purchases of

items significant

to our

business 

to ensure

continuity of

operations. Our

objective is

to procure

materials meeting

both our quality

standards and

our production

needs 

at price levels

that allow a targeted

profit margin. Since

these inputs generally

represent the largest

variable cost in manufacturing

our 

products, to the

extent possible, we

often manage the

risk associated with

adverse price movements

for some inputs

using a variety

of 

risk

management

strategies.

We

also

have

a

grain

merchandising

operation

that

provides

us

efficient

access

to,

and

more

informed 

knowledge of, various commodity

markets, principally wheat and oats.

This operation holds physical inventories

that are carried at net 

realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize

its market exposures. 

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS 

Our

products

are

marketed

under

a

variety

of

valuable

We

protect

these

trademarks

as

appropriate 

through registrations in the

United States and other jurisdictions.

Depending on the jurisdiction,

trademarks are generally valid

as long 

as they are in use

or their registrations are properly

maintained and they have

not been found to have

become generic. Registrations of 

trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for

as long as the trademarks are in use.

Some

of

our

products

are

marketed

under

or

in

combination

with

trademarks

that

have

been

licensed

from

others

for

both

long-

standing

products

(e.g., 

Reese’s

Puffs

for

cereal, 

Green

Giant 

for vegetables

in certain

countries, and 

Yoplait 

and related

brands for 

fresh dairy in the United States), and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit

snacks sold under various third party equities). 

Our cereal

trademarks

are licensed

to CPW

and

may be

used in

association

with the 

Nestlé 

trademark.

Nestlé licenses

certain

of its 

trademarks

to

CPW,

including

the 

Nestlé

and 

Uncle

Toby’s

trademarks.

The 

Häagen-Dazs

trademark

is

licensed

royalty-free

and 

exclusively

to

Nestlé

and

authorized

sublicensees

for

ice

cream

and

other

frozen dessert

products

in

the

United

States and

Canada.

The 

Häagen-Dazs

trademark is

also licensed

to HDJ

in Japan.

The 

Pillsbury

brand and

the 

Pillsbury Doughboy

character are

subject 

to

an

exclusive,

royalty-free

license

that

was

granted

to

a

third

party

and

its

successors

in

the

shelf-stable

baking

categories

in

the 

United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and Mexico.

We

continue

our

focus

on

developing

and

marketing

innovative,

proprietary

products,

many

of

which

use

proprietary

expertise, 

recipes and formulations,

and are patent protected. We

consider the collective rights under our various patents, which

expire from time 

to time, a valuable asset,

but we do not

believe that our businesses are

materially dependent upon

any single patent or group

of related 

patents. 

SEASONALITY 

In

general,

demand

for

our

products

is

evenly

balanced

throughout

the

year.

However,

within

our

North

America

Retail

segment 

demand

for

refrigerated

dough,

frozen

baked

goods,

and

baking

products

is

stronger

in

the

fourth

calendar

quarter.

Demand

for 

Progresso 

soup is higher

during the

fall and winter

months. Within

our International

segment, demand

for 

Häagen-Dazs 

ice cream is 

higher during

the summer

months and

demand for

baking mix

increases during

winter months.

Due to

the offsetting

impact of

these 

demand

trends,

as well

as the

different

seasons

in

the

northern

and

southern

hemispheres,

our

International

segment’s

net

sales are 

generally evenly balanced throughout the year. 

QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION 

The

manufacture

and

sale

of

human

and

pet

food

products

is

highly

regulated.

In

the

United

States,

our

activities

are

subject

to 

regulation by

various federal

government agencies,

including the

Food and

Drug Administration,

Department of

Agriculture, Federal 

Trade

Commission,

Department

of

Commerce,

Occupational

Safety

and

Health

Administration,

and

Environmental

Protection 

Agency,

as

well

as

various

federal,

state,

and

local

agencies

relating

to

the

production,

packaging,

labelling,

marketing,

storage, 

distribution, quality,

and safety of food

and pet products and

the health and safety

of our employees.

Our business is also

regulated by 

similar agencies outside of the United States. 

6 

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS 

As

of

May

25,

2025,

we

were

involved

with

two

response

actions

associated

with

the

alleged

or

threatened

release

of

hazardous 

substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New

Jersey.

Our

operations

are

subject

to

the

Clean

Air

Act,

Clean

Water

Act,

Resource

Conservation

and

Recovery

Act,

Comprehensive 

Environmental

Response,

Compensation,

and

Liability

Act,

and

the

Federal

Insecticide,

Fungicide,

and

Rodenticide

Act,

and

all 

similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable

to the jurisdictions in which we operate. 

Based on current

facts and circumstances,

we believe that

neither the

results of our

environmental proceedings

nor our compliance

in 

general

with

environmental

laws

or

regulations

will

have

a

material

adverse

effect

upon

our

capital

expenditures,

earnings,

or 

competitive position. 

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Recruiting, developing, engaging, and protecting our

workforce is critical to executing our strategy and achieving

business success. As 

of

May

25,

2025,

we

had

approximately

33,000

employees

around

the

globe,

with

approximately

17,000

in

the

U.S.

and 

approximately 16,000

located in our

markets outside

of the U.S.

Our workforce

is divided

between approximately

13,000 employees 

dedicated to the production of our products and approximately 20,

000 non-production employees.

The

efficient

production

of

high-quality

products

and

successful

execution

of

our

strategy

requires

a

talented,

skilled,

and

engaged 

team of employees. We

work to equip our employees with

critical skills and expand their contributions

over time by providing a range 

of training and career

development opportunities, including

hands-on experiences via

challenging work assignments and

job rotations, 

coaching

and mentoring

opportunities, and

training programs.

To

foster employee

engagement and

commitment, we

follow a

robust 

process

to

listen

to

employees,

take

action,

and

measure

our

progress

with

on-going

employee

conversations,

transparent 

communications, and employee engagement surveys. 

We

believe that

fostering a

culture of

belonging is

the right

thing to

do for

our employees

and business.

It strengthens

our ability

to 

recruit talent and provides all

of our employees with an

environment where they have

an opportunity to thrive and

succeed. Champion 

Belonging

– a

Company

value –

helps bring

to life

our

culture of

belonging through

respecting and

including

all voices,

ideas, and 

perspectives.

We

embed

our

culture

of

belonging

into

our

day-to-day

ways

of

working

through

a

number

of

programs

to

foster 

discussion, build empathy,

and increase understanding. 

We

are

committed

to

maintaining

a

safe

and

secure

workplace

for

our

employees.

We

set

specific

safety

standards

to

identify

and 

manage critical risks.

We

use global safety

management systems and

employee training to

ensure consistent implementation

of safety 

protocols and

accurate measurement

and tracking of

incidents. To

provide a safe

and secure working

environment for our

employees, 

we prohibit workplace

discrimination, and

we do not

tolerate abusive conduct

or harassment. Our

attention to the

health and safety

of 

our workforce extends to the workers and communities in our supply chain.

We believe that respect

for human rights is fundamental to 

our strategy and to our commitment to ethical business conduct.

ITEM 1A - Risk Factors

Our

business

is

subject

to

various

risks

and

uncertainties.

Any

of

the

risks

described

below

could

materially,

adversely

affect

our 

business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Business and Industry Risks 

The

categories

in

which

we

participate

are

very

competitive,

and

if

we

are

not

able

to

compete

effectively,

our

results

of 

operations could be adversely

affected.

The

human

and

pet

food

categories

in

which

we

participate

are

very

competitive.

Our principal

competitors

in

these

categories

are 

manufacturers,

as

well

as

retailers

with

their

own

branded

and

private

label

products.

Competitors

market

and

sell

their

products 

through

brick-and-mortar

stores

and

e-commerce.

All

of

our

principal

competitors

have

substantial

financial,

marketing,

and

other 

resources.

In

most

product

categories,

we

compete

not

only

with

other

widely

advertised

branded

products,

but

also

with

regional 

brands

and

with

generic

and

private

label

products

that

are generally

sold

at

lower prices.

Competition

in

our

product

categories

is 

based on

product

innovation, product

quality,

price,

brand recognition

and loyalty,

effectiveness

of marketing,

promotional

activity, 

convenient

ordering

and

delivery

to

the

consumer,

and

the

ability

to

identify

and

satisfy

consumer

preferences.

If

our

large 

competitors

were

to

seek

an

advantage

through

pricing

or

promotional

changes,

we

could

choose

to

do

the

same,

which

could 

adversely affect

our margins

and profitability.

If we

did not

do the

same, our

revenues and

market share

could be

adversely affected. 

Our market share

and revenue growth

could also be

adversely impacted if

we are not

successful in introducing

innovative products

in 

response

to

changing

consumer

demands

or by

new product

introductions

of our

competitors.

If

we

are unable

to build

and

sustain 

brand

equity

by

offering

recognizably

superior

product

quality,

we

may

be

unable

to

maintain

premium

pricing

over

generic

and 

private label products. 

We may be unable to maintain our profit

margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.

There has

been significant

consolidation in

the grocery industry,

resulting in

customers with increased

purchasing power.

In addition, 

large

retail

customers

may

seek

to

use

their

position

to

improve

their

profitability

through

improved

efficiency,

lower

pricing, 

increased

reliance

on

their

own

brand

name

products,

increased

emphasis

on

generic

and

other

economy

brands,

and

increased 

promotional

programs.

If we

are

unable

to use

our

scale, marketing

expertise,

product

innovation,

knowledge

of consumers’

needs, 

and category

leadership positions

to respond

to these

demands, our

profitability and

volume growth

could be

negatively impacted.

In 

addition, the loss

of any large

customer could

adversely affect our

sales and profits.

In fiscal 2025,

Walmart

accounted for 22

percent 

of our

consolidated net

sales and

31 percent

of net

sales of

our North

America Retail

segment.

For more

information on

significant 

customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this

report. 

Price

changes

for

the

commodities

we

depend

on

for

raw

materials,

packaging,

and

energy

may

adversely

affect

our 

profitability.

The

principal

raw

materials

that

we

use

are

commodities

that

experience

price

volatility

caused

by

external

conditions

such

as 

weather,

climate

change,

product

scarcity,

limited

sources

of

supply,

commodity

market

fluctuations,

currency

fluctuations,

trade 

tariffs

(including

recent

tariffs

imposed

or

threatened

to

be

imposed

by

the

United

States

on

China,

Canada,

Mexico,

and

other 

countries and any retaliatory

actions taken by such

countries), pandemics, war

(including sanctions imposed

on Russia for its

invasion 

of Ukraine),

and changes in

governmental agricultural

and energy

policies and regulations.

Commodity prices

have become, and

may 

continue

to be,

more volatile.

Commodity price

changes may

result in

unexpected increases

in raw

material, packaging,

energy,

and 

transportation costs. If we

are unable to increase

productivity to offset

these increased costs or

increase our prices, we

may experience 

9 

reduced margins

and profitability.

We

do not

fully hedge

against changes

in commodity

prices, and

the risk

management procedures 

that we do use may not always work as we intend.

Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers

to

avoid certain products or ingredients.

We

could

be

adversely

affected

if

consumers

in

our

principal

markets

lose

confidence

in

the

safety

and

quality

of

certain

of

our 

products

or

ingredients.

Adverse

publicity

about

these

types

of

concerns,

whether

or

not

valid,

may

discourage

consumers

from 

buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. 

We

may be

unable to

anticipate changes

in consumer

preferences and

trends,

which may

result in

decreased demand

for our 

products.

Our

success

depends

in

part

on

our

ability

to

anticipate

the

tastes,

eating

habits

(including

the

impact

of

weight

loss

drugs),

and 

purchasing

behaviors

of

consumers

and

to

offer

products

that

appeal

to

their

preferences

in

channels

where

they

shop.

Consumer 

preferences

and category-level

consumption

may change

from time

to time

and can

be affected

by a

number of

different

trends and 

other factors. If we fail

to anticipate, identify or react to

these changes and trends, such as

adapting to emerging

e-commerce channels, 

or to

introduce new

and improved

products on

a timely

basis, we

may experience

reduced demand

for our

products, which

would in 

turn

cause

our

revenues

and

profitability

to

suffer.

Similarly,

demand

for

our

products

could

be

affected

by

consumer

concerns 

regarding

the

health

effects

of

ingredients

such

as

sodium,

genetically

modified

organisms,

sugar

and

sugar

alternatives,

color 

additives,

preservatives,

processed

wheat

and

other

ingredients,

grain-free

or

legume-rich

pet

food,

or

other

product

ingredients

or 

attributes. 

We may be unable to grow

our market share or add products that are

in faster

growing and more profitable categories.

The

food

industry’s

growth

potential

is

constrained

by

population

growth.

Our

success

depends

in

part

on

our

ability

to

grow

our 

business faster than

populations are growing

in the markets

that we serve.

One way to

achieve that growth

is to enhance

our portfolio 

by adding innovative

new products in faster

growing and more

profitable categories. Our future

results will also depend

on our ability 

to

increase

market

share

in

our

existing

product

categories.

If

we

do

not

succeed

in

developing

innovative

products

for

new

and 

existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely

affected. 

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain

their favorable perception of our brands.

Maintaining and continually

enhancing the value

of our many

iconic brands is critical

to the success of

our business. The value

of our 

brands

is

based

in

large

part

on

the

degree

to

which

consumers

react

and

respond

positively

to

these

brands.

Brand

value

could 

diminish

significantly

due

to

a

number

of

factors,

including

consumer

perception

that

we

have

acted

in

an

irresponsible

manner, 

adverse publicity

about our

products, our

failure to

maintain the

quality of

our products,

concerns or

perceptions about

the nutrition 

profile and

health effects

of ingredients

or substances

(including the

processing thereof)

in our

products or

packaging, the

failure of 

our products to

deliver consistently positive

consumer experiences, concerns

about food safety,

or our products

becoming unavailable 

to consumers. Consumer demand for our products

may also be impacted by changes in the level

of advertising or promotional support. 

The

use

of

social

and

digital

media

by

consumers,

us,

and

third

parties

increases

the

speed

and

extent

that

information

or 

misinformation

and

opinions

can

be

shared.

Negative

posts

or

comments

about

us,

our

brands,

or

our

products

on

social

or

digital 

media could

seriously damage

our brands

and reputation.

If we

do not

maintain the

favorable perception

of our

brands, our

business 

results could be negatively impacted. 

Operating Risks 

If

we

are

not

efficient

in

our

production,

our

profitability

could

suffer

as

a

result

of

the

highly

competitive

environment

in 

which we operate.

Our future success and

earnings growth depend in

part on our ability to

be efficient in the

production and manufacture of

our products 

in

highly

competitive

markets.

Gaining

additional

efficiencies

may

become

more

difficult

over

time.

Our

failure

to

reduce

costs 

through

productivity

gains

or

by

eliminating

redundant

costs

resulting

from

acquisitions

or

divestitures

could

adversely

affect

our 

profitability

and

weaken

our

competitive

position.

Many

productivity

initiatives

involve

complex

reorganization

of

manufacturing 

facilities

and

production

lines.

Such

manufacturing

realignment

may

result

in

the

interruption

of

production,

which

may

negatively 

impact product

volume and

margins. We

periodically engage

in restructuring,

transformation, and

cost savings

initiatives designed

to 

increase our

efficiency and

reduce expenses. If

we are unable

to execute

those initiatives as

planned, we

may not realize

all or any

of 

the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and

results of operations. 

10 

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.

Our

ability

to

make,

move,

and

sell

products

is

critical

to

our

success.

Damage

or

disruption

to

raw

material

supplies

or

our 

manufacturing

or

distribution

capabilities

due

to

weather,

climate

change,

natural

disaster,

fire,

terrorism,

cyber-attack,

pandemics, 

war,

governmental

restrictions

or

mandates,

labor

shortages,

strikes,

import/export

restrictions,

or

other

factors

could

impair

our 

ability to

manufacture or

sell our

products. Many

of our

product lines

are manufactured

at a

single location

or sourced

from a

single 

supplier.

The

failure

of

third

parties

on

which

we

rely,

including

those

third

parties

who

supply

our

ingredients,

packaging,

capital 

equipment

and

other

necessary

operating

materials,

contract

manufacturers,

commercial

transport,

distributors,

contractors,

and 

external business partners, to meet

their obligations to us, or significant

disruptions in their ability to do

so, may negatively impact our 

operations. Our

suppliers’ policies

and practices

can damage

our reputation

and the quality

and safety

of our

products. Disputes

with 

significant suppliers,

including disputes regarding

pricing or performance,

could adversely affect

our ability to

supply products to

our 

customers and

could materially

and adversely

affect our

sales, financial

condition, and

results of

operations. Failure

to take

adequate 

steps

to

mitigate

the

likelihood

or

potential

impact

of

such

events,

or

to

effectively

manage

such

events

if

they

occur,

particularly 

when a

product is

sourced from

a single

location or

supplier,

could adversely

affect our

business and

results of

operations, as

well as 

require additional resources to restore our supply chain. 

Short term or

sustained increases in

consumer demand at

our retail customers

may exceed our

production capacity or

otherwise strain 

our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could

adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Our international operations are subject to political and economic

risks.

In fiscal

2025, 19

percent of

our consolidated

net sales

were generated

outside of

the United

States. We

are accordingly

subject to

a 

number of risks relating to doing business internationally,

any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 

●

political and economic instability; 

●

exchange controls and currency exchange rates; 

●

tariffs on products and

ingredients that we import and export

(including recent tariffs imposed

or threatened to be imposed by 

the United States on China, Canada, Mexico, and other countries and any retaliatory

actions taken by such countries); 

●

political sentiment impacting

global trade, including

the willingness of consumers

outside the United States

to purchase from 

United States corporations or to purchase products manufactured outside the country

of sale; 

●

nationalization or government control of operations; 

●

compliance with anti-corruption regulations; 

●

foreign tax treaties and policies; and 

●

restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including

potentially negative tax consequences. 

Our financial performance

on a U.S. dollar

denominated basis is subject

to fluctuations in currency

exchange rates. These fluctuations 

could cause material

variations in our results

of operations. Our principal

exposures are to the

Australian dollar,

Brazilian real, British 

pound sterling,

Canadian dollar,

Chinese renminbi,

euro, Japanese

yen, Mexican

peso, and

Swiss franc.

From time

to time,

we enter 

into

agreements

that

are

intended

to

reduce

the

effects

of

our

exposure

to

currency

fluctuations,

but

these

agreements

may

not

be 

effective in significantly reducing our exposure. 

A

strengthening

in

the

U.S.

dollar

relative

to

other

currencies

in

the

countries

in

which

we

operate

would

negatively

affect

our 

reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and

currency transaction losses. 

Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology

systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.

Information

technology

serves

an

important

role

in

the

efficient

and

effective

operation

of

our

business.

We

rely

on

information 

technology networks

and systems, including

the internet, to

process, transmit,

and store electronic

information to

manage a variety

of 

business processes and

to comply with

regulatory,

legal, and tax requirements.

Our information technology

systems and infrastructure 

are

critical

to

effectively

manage

our

key

business

processes

including

digital

marketing,

order

entry

and

fulfillment,

supply

chain 

management,

finance,

administration,

and

other

business

processes.

These

technologies

enable

internal

and

external

communication 

among

our

locations, employees,

suppliers,

customers,

and others

and

include the

receipt and

storage of

personal information

about 

our employees,

consumers, and

proprietary business

information. Our

information technology

systems, some

of which

are dependent 

on services

provided

by third

parties, may

be vulnerable

to damage,

interruption,

or shutdown

due to

any number

of causes

such as 

catastrophic events,

natural disasters, fires,

power outages, systems

failures, telecommunications

failures, security breaches,

computer 

viruses, hackers, employee error

or malfeasance, and other

causes. Increased cyber-security threats

pose a potential risk to

the security 

and

viability

of

our

information

technology

systems,

as

well

as

the

confidentiality,

integrity,

and

availability

of

the

data

stored

on 

those systems. The

failure of our

information technology

systems to perform

as we anticipate

could disrupt

our business and

result in 

transaction

errors,

processing

inefficiencies,

data

loss,

legal

claims

or

proceedings,

regulatory

penalties,

and

the

loss

of

sales

and 

customers. Any

interruption of

our information

technology systems

could have

operational, reputational,

legal, and

financial impacts 

that may have a material adverse effect on our business. 

11 

Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our

existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.

From

time

to

time,

we

evaluate

potential

acquisitions

or

joint

ventures

that

would

further

our

strategic

objectives.

Our

success 

depends, in part,

upon our ability

to integrate acquired

and existing operations.

If we are

unable to successfully

integrate acquisitions, 

our financial

results could

suffer.

Additional potential

risks associated

with acquisitions

include

additional debt

leverage, the

loss of 

key

employees

and

customers

of

the

acquired

business,

the

assumption

of

unknown

liabilities,

the

inherent

risk

associated

with 

entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have

no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated

synergies, 

and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets. 

Legal and Regulatory Risks 

If

our

products

become

adulterated,

misbranded,

or

mislabeled,

we

might

need

to

recall

those

items

and

may

experience 

product liability claims if

consumers or their pets are injured.

We may need

to recall some of our products if they become adulterated,

misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could 

result in

significant losses

due to

the costs

of a

recall, the

destruction of

product inventory,

and lost

sales due

to the

unavailability of 

product for a period of time.

We could

also suffer losses from a

significant product liability judgment

against us. A significant product 

recall or

product liability

case could

also result

in adverse

publicity,

damage to

our reputation,

and a

loss of

consumer confidence

in 

our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the

value of our brands. 

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely

affect our business.

Our facilities and

products are subject

to many laws and

regulations administered by

the United States Department

of Agriculture, the 

Federal Food and Drug

Administration, the Occupational

Safety and Health Administration,

and other federal, state, local,

and foreign 

governmental agencies

relating to

the production,

packaging, labelling,

storage, distribution,

quality,

and safety

of food

products and 

the

health

and

safety

of

our

employees.

Our

failure

to

comply

with

such

laws

and

regulations

could

subject

us

to

lawsuits, 

administrative

penalties,

and civil

remedies,

including fines,

injunctions,

and recalls

of our

products.

We

advertise our

products and 

could be

the target

of claims

relating to

alleged false

or deceptive

advertising

under federal,

state, and

foreign laws

and regulations. 

We

may

also

be

subject

to

new

laws

or

regulations

restricting

the

marketing

or

sale

of

our

products

because

of

ingredients

or 

substances (including

the processing

thereof)

in our

products or

product packaging.

These limitations

may

require that

we highlight 

perceived concerns

about a

product or

product packaging,

warn consumers

to avoid

consumption of

certain ingredients

or substances 

present in our products,

restrict the audience

to whom products are

marketed or sold, limit

the locations in which

our products may be 

available, or discontinue

the use of

certain ingredients or

packaging. Changes

in laws or

regulations that impose

additional regulatory 

requirements

on us

could

increase our

cost of

doing business,

restrict our

actions,

and reduce

consumption

of our

products, causing 

our results of operations to be adversely affected. 

We

are

subject

to

various

federal,

state,

local,

and

foreign

environmental

laws

and

regulations.

Our

failure

to

comply

with 

environmental laws and regulations could subject us

to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies.

We are currently

party to 

a variety of

environmental remediation obligations.

Due to regulatory

complexities, uncertainties inherent

in litigation, and

the risk of 

unidentified contaminants

on current and

former properties of

ours, the potential

exists for remediation,

liability,

indemnification, and 

compliance

costs

to

differ

from

our

estimates.

We

cannot

guarantee

that

our

costs

in

relation

to

these

matters,

or

compliance

with 

environmental

laws

in

general,

will

not

exceed

our

established

liabilities

or

otherwise

have

an

adverse

effect

on

our

business

and 

results of operations. 

Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect

our business. 

There is

growing concern

that carbon

dioxide and

other greenhouse

gases in

the earth’s

atmosphere may

have an

adverse impact

on 

global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency

and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.

If such climate change 

has a negative effect on agricultural productivity,

we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities 

that are necessary

for our

products. Increased

frequency or

severity of

extreme weather

could also impair

our production

capabilities, 

disrupt our

supply chain,

impact demand

for our

products, and

increase our

insurance and

other operating

costs.

Increasing concern 

over

climate

change

or

other

sustainability

issues

also

may

adversely

impact

demand

for

our

products

due

to

changes

in

consumer 

preferences or

negative consumer

reaction to

our commitments

and actions

to address

these issues.

We

may also

become subject

to 

additional

legal

and

regulatory

requirements

relating

to

climate

change

or

other

sustainability

issues,

including

greenhouse

gas 

emission

regulations

(e.g.,

carbon

taxes),

energy

policies,

sustainability

initiatives

(e.g.,

single-use

plastic

limits),

and

disclosure 

obligations.

If additional legal

and regulatory

requirements are

enacted and

are more aggressive

than the sustainability

measures that 

we are currently

undertaking to reduce

our emissions and

improve our energy

efficiency and

other sustainability goals,

or if we

chose 

to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant

increases in our costs of operations. 

12 

We

have announced goals

and commitments to

reduce our carbon footprint.

If we fail to

achieve or improperly

report on our progress 

toward

achieving

our

carbon

emissions

reduction

goals

and

commitments,

then

the

resulting

negative

publicity

could

harm

our 

reputation and adversely affect demand for our products. 

Financial and Economic Risks 

Volatility

in

the

market

value

of

derivatives

we

use

to

manage

exposures

to

fluctuations

in

commodity

prices

may

cause 

volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.

We

utilize derivatives

to manage

price risk

for some

of our

principal ingredient

and energy

costs, including

grains (oats,

wheat, and 

corn), oils (principally soybean),

dairy products, natural gas, and diesel

fuel. Changes in the values

of these derivatives are recorded

in 

earnings, which

may result

in volatility

in both

gross margin

and net

earnings. These

gains and

losses are

reported in

cost of

sales in 

our Consolidated

Statements of Earnings

and in unallocated

corporate items outside

our segment operating

results until we

utilize the 

underlying input in our manufacturing

process, at which time the gains

and losses are reclassified to segment

operating profit. We

also 

record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We

may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. 

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.

The

willingness

of

consumers

to

purchase

our

products

depends

in

part

on

local

economic

conditions.

In

periods

of

economic 

uncertainty,

consumers

may

purchase

more

generic,

private

label,

and

other

economy

brands

and

may

forego

certain

purchases 

altogether.

In those circumstances,

we could experience

a reduction in sales

of higher margin

products or a shift

in our product mix

to 

lower margin

offerings.

In addition,

as a

result of

economic conditions

or competitive

actions, we

may be

unable to

raise our

prices 

sufficiently to

protect margins.

Consumers may

also reduce the

amount of food

that they consume

away from home

at customers that 

purchase products

from our

North America

Foodservice segment.

Any of

these events

could have

an adverse

effect on

our results

of 

operations. 

We

have

a

substantial

amount

of

indebtedness,

which

could

limit

financing

and

other

options

and

in

some

cases

adversely 

affect our ability to pay dividends.

As

of

May

25,

2025,

we

had

total

debt

and

noncontrolling

interests

of

$14.9

billion.

The

agreements

under

which

we

have

issued 

indebtedness

do not

prevent us

from

incurring

additional unsecured

indebtedness

in the

future.

Our level

of indebtedness

may

limit 

our: 

●

ability to

obtain additional

financing for

working capital,

capital expenditures,

or general

corporate purposes,

particularly if 

the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations

were revised downward; and 

●

flexibility to

adjust to

changing business

and market

conditions and

may make

us more

vulnerable to

a downturn

in general 

economic conditions. 

There are

various financial

covenants and

other restrictions

in our

debt instruments

and noncontrolling

interests. If

we fail to

comply 

with any of

these requirements, the

related indebtedness,

and other unrelated

indebtedness, could

become due and

payable prior

to its 

stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing

may also be adversely affected. 

Our ability

to make

scheduled payments

on or

to refinance

our debt

and other

obligations will

depend on

our operating

and financial 

performance,

which

in

turn

is

subject

to

prevailing

economic

conditions

and

to

financial,

business,

and

other

factors

beyond

our 

control. 

We

depend

on stable,

liquid

and

well-functioning

capital and

credit markets

to fund

our operations.

Our financial

performance,

our 

credit ratings,

interest rates,

the stability

of financial

institutions with

which we

partner, and

the liquidity

of the

overall global

capital 

markets could affect our access to, and the availability,

terms and conditions, and cost of capital. 

Volatility

in the

securities markets,

interest

rates,

and other

factors could

substantially

increase

our defined

benefit

pension, 

other postretirement benefit, and postemployment

benefit costs.

We

sponsor

a number

of defined

benefit plans

for employees

in the

United

States, Canada,

and various

foreign

locations, including 

defined

benefit

pension,

retiree

health

and

welfare,

severance,

and

other

postemployment

plans.

Our

major

defined

benefit

pension 

plans are

funded with

trust assets

invested in

a globally

diversified portfolio

of securities

and other

investments. Changes

in interest 

rates, mortality

rates, health

care costs,

early

retirement rates,

investment

returns, and

the market

value of

plan

assets can

affect

the 

funded status

of our

defined benefit

plans and

cause volatility

in the

net periodic

benefit cost

and future

funding requirements

of the 

plans.

A

significant

increase

in

our

obligations

or

future

funding

requirements

could

have

a

negative

impact

on

our

results

of 

operations and cash flows from operations. 

13 

A

change

in

the

assumptions

regarding

the

future

performance

of

our

businesses

or

a

different

weighted-average

cost

of 

capital

used

to

value

our

reporting

units

or

our

indefinite-lived

intangible

assets

could

negatively

affect

our

consolidated 

results of operations and net worth.

As of May

25, 2025,

we had $22.4

billion of

goodwill and

indefinite-lived intangible

assets. Goodwill for

each of

our reporting

units 

is tested

for impairment

annually and

whenever events

or changes

in circumstances

indicate that

impairment may

have occurred.

We 

compare

the

carrying

value

of

the

reporting

unit,

including

goodwill,

to

the

fair

value

of

the

reporting

unit.

If

the

fair

value

of

the 

reporting unit

is less than

the carrying

value of

the reporting

unit, including

goodwill, impairment

has occurred.

Our estimates

of fair 

value are determined

based on a

discounted cash

flow model. Growth

rates for sales

and profits are

determined using inputs

from our 

long-range planning process. We

also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions,

market comparables, and other 

factors.

If

current

expectations

for

growth

rates

for

sales

and

profits

are

not

met,

or

other

market

factors

and

macroeconomic 

conditions were to change,

then our reporting units could

become significantly impaired. While

we currently believe that

our goodwill 

is not impaired, different assumptions regarding

the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment

losses. 

We

evaluate

the

useful

lives

of

our

intangible

assets,

primarily

intangible

assets

associated

with

the 

Blue

Buffalo

,

Pillsbury

, 

Totino’s

, 

Progresso

, 

Old El Paso

,

Tiki Pets

, 

Annie’s

, 

Nudges

,

Edgard &

Cooper

,

and 

Häagen-Dazs

brands, to

determine if 

they

are finite

or indefinite-lived.

Reaching a

determination on

useful

life requires

significant judgments

and assumptions

regarding 

the

future

effects

of

obsolescence,

demand,

competition,

other

economic

factors

(such

as

the

stability

of

the

industry,

known 

technological

advances,

legislative

action

that

results

in

an

uncertain

or

changing

regulatory

environment,

and

expected

changes

in 

distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures,

and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. 

Our

indefinite-lived

intangible

assets

are

also

tested

for

impairment

annually

and

whenever

events

or

changes

in

circumstances 

indicate

that impairment

may have

occurred.

Our estimate

of the

fair value

of the

brands is

based on

a discounted

cash flow

model 

using inputs

including projected

revenues from

our long-range

plan, assumed

royalty rates which

could be

payable if we

did not

own 

the brands, and

a discount rate.

If current expectations

for growth

rates for sales

and margins

are not met,

or other market

factors and 

macroeconomic

conditions

were

to

change,

then

our

indefinite-lived

intangible

assets

could

become

significantly

impaired. 

Our 

Progresso

,

Nudges

,

Uncle Toby’s

,

True

Chews

, and 

Kitano

brands had

risk of

decreasing

coverage

and we

continue

to monitor 

these businesses.

ITEM 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

ITEM 1C - Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

Our

enterprise

risk

management

framework

considers

cybersecurity

risk

alongside

other

company

risks,

as 

part of

our

overall

risk 

assessment

process.

We

leverage

an

industry-leading

framework,

the

National

Institute

of Standards

and

Technology

Cybersecurity 

Framework, and assess our maturity against that framework in partnership

with an independent firm on an annual basis.

We

assess

and

manage

our

cybersecurity

risk

using

various

mechanisms,

starting

with

threat

intelligence,

which

provides

us

a 

necessary viewpoint to help

us identify trends, understand

how certain attacks may affect

us, and prepare for

evolutions in threat actor 

behavior

that

may

require

changes

to

our

security

posture.

To

drive

readiness,

we

perform

periodic

adversarial

testing

of

our 

cybersecurity

posture through

penetration

testing, using

both internal

resources

and

external expertise,

as well

as table-top

and

“red 

team” exercises to understand where processes or controls may be insufficient

based on adversarial techniques. 

Our 

internal

audit team performs

regular assessments

of our

program and

selected components.

We

also 

leverage

retrospectives from 

previous

cybersecurity

incidents

to

understand

weaknesses

and

to

improve

our

security

controls.

We

assess

our

critical

suppliers 

regularly for cybersecurity risk

and prescribe remediation

activities when necessary.

As a part of

a collaborative defense approach,

we 

regularly participate in multiple cybersecurity forums to share threat

intelligence, best practices, and points of caution. 

We

train

our

employees

through

annual

security

training,

phishing

simulations,

and

regular

communications

about

timely 

cybersecurity

topics

and

threats.

We

have

a

documented

and

well-tested

cybersecurity

incident

response

plan

that

guides

us

in 

responding,

containing,

and

eradicating

cybersecurity

threats

that

have

breached

our

preventative

controls.

We

regularly

practice 

technical recovery,

and we maintain cybersecurity insurance.

14 

Cybersecurity Governance

Our

cybersecurity

program

is 

led by

our

Chief

Digital

and

Technology

Officer

(CDTO)

and

Vice

President

of

Cyber

Security

&

Enterprise

Architecture.

Our Vice

President

of Cyber

Security &

Enterprise Architecture,

who

reports to

our CDTO,

has a

master’s 

degree

in

information

assurance,

and

more

than

20

years

of

experience

working

in

this

field,

including

more

than

13

years

with 

General Mills. He has strategic and operational responsibility

for all aspects of the Company’s

cybersecurity program, from how cyber 

risks are identified, to how General Mills detects, responds, contains, and recovers

from cybersecurity threats.

The

Audit

Committee

of

our

Board

of

Directors

provides

oversight

for

our

cybersecurity

program.

The

Audit

Committee

receives 

regular

updates

from

management

on

the

effectiveness

of

our

cybersecurity

program,

reviews

plans

on

how

management

will 

continually

mature

the

program,

and

receives

updates

on

special

topics

that

help

the

committee

provide

effective

oversight

of

the 

program.

Our 

Security &

Resilience Governance

Committee provides

oversight and

governance

for the

Company’s

cybersecurity risk

through 

quarterly

meetings,

monthly

dashboard

reporting

on

management-aligned

program

performance

targets,

and

as-needed

updates

on 

cybersecurity

incidents.

This 

committee

is

composed

of

our

Chief

Financial

Officer,

General

Counsel,

Chief

Human

Resources 

Officer, Chief Supply Chain Officer,

and CDTO.

Like

most

companies,

our

systems are

continually

subjected

to

cybersecurity

threats. 

Although

we

have 

not

experienced

a

material 

cybersecurity breach,

we cannot guarantee

that we will

not experience

a cyber threat

or incident in

the future.

Additional information 

on cybersecurity

risks we

face is included

in Item 1A

of this report,

which should

be read

in conjunction

with the

information in

this 

Item 1C.

ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

We 

are

a

global packaged

foods company. 

We 

develop

distinctive

value-added

food

products

and

market

them under

unique

brand 

names. 

We 

work

continuously

to

improve

our

core

products

and

to

create

new

products

that

meet

consumers’

evolving

needs

and 

preferences.

In

addition,

we

build

the

equity

of

our

brands

over

time

with

strong

consumer-directed

marketing,

innovative

new 

products,

and

effective

merchandising. 

We 

believe

our

brand-building

approach

is

the

key

to

winning

and

sustaining

leading

share 

positions in markets around the globe. 

Our fundamental

financial goal is

to generate competitively

differentiated returns

for our shareholders

over the long

term. 

We 

believe 

achieving

that

goal

requires

us

to

generate

a

consistent

balance

of

net

sales

growth,

margin

expansion,

cash

conversion,

and

cash 

return to shareholders over time. 

Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance

on average over time: 

●

2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales; 

●

mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit; 

●

mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share

(EPS); 

●

free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings

after tax; and 

●

cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow,

including an attractive dividend yield. 

Guided by our

purpose to make

food the world

loves, we are

executing our Accelerate

strategy to drive

sustainable, profitable growth 

and

top-tier

shareholder

returns

over

the

long

term.

The

strategy

focuses

on

four

pillars

to

create

competitive

advantages

and

win: 

boldly

building

brands,

relentlessly

innovating,

unleashing

our

scale,

and

standing

for

good. 

We 

are

prioritizing

our

core

markets, 

global

platforms,

and

local

gem

brands

that

have

the

best

prospects

for

profitable

growth,

and

we

are

committed

to

reshaping

our 

portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further enhance

our growth profile. 

Our

consolidated

net

sales

for

fiscal

2025

declined

2

percent

to

$19.5

billion.

On

an

organic

basis,

net

sales

decreased

2

percent 

compared to year-ago levels. Operating

profit of $3.3 billion decreased

4 percent. Adjusted operating profit

of $3.4 billion decreased 7 

percent on a

constant-currency basis.

Diluted EPS declined

5 percent to

$4.10. Adjusted diluted

EPS of $4.21

decreased 7 percent

on 

a

constant-currency

basis

(See

the

“Non-GAAP

Measures”

section

below

for

a

description

of

our

use

of

measures

not

defined

by 

generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). 

Net cash

provided

by operations

totaled $2,918

million in

fiscal 2025

representing a

conversion rate

of 126

percent of

net earnings, 

including

earnings attributable

to noncontrolling

interests. This

cash generation

supported capital

investments

totaling $625

million, 

and

our

resulting

free

cash

flow was

$2,293

million

at

a

conversion

rate

of 97

percent of

adjusted

net

earnings,

including

earnings 

attributable

to

noncontrolling

interests. 

We 

returned

cash

to

shareholders

through

dividends

totaling

$1,339

million

and

share 

repurchases

totaling

$1,203

million

(See

the

“Non-GAAP

Measures”

section

below

for

a

description

of

our

use

of

measures

not 

defined by GAAP). 

In

fiscal

2025,

the

operating

environment

was

characterized

by

significant

volatility

and

uncertainty,

resulting

in

value-seeking 

behaviors by

consumers that

were deeper

and more

prolonged than

we expected.

As a

result, we

made important

changes to

adapt to 

the evolving

environment and

put our

business on

a path

back to

growth. 

We 

increased investment

to bring

consumers greater

value, 

which strengthened our

pound volume performance

as we exited the

year.

While the level of

incremental investment

resulted in fiscal 

2025

financial

results

below

our

targeted

ranges,

we

expect

the

improved

pound

volume

and

household

penetration

trends

will 

translate into stronger top- and bottom-line performance over the long

term.

We 

delivered mixed performance against the three priorities we established

at the beginning of the year:

We 

did not achieve our objective

of accelerating organic net sales

growth, with full-year organic

net sales declining 2 percent 

driven primarily

by unfavorable

organic net

price realization

and mix

resulting from

our increased

investments in

consumer 

value (see the ‘Non-GAAP Measures” section below for our use of

this measure not defined by GAAP).

We 

successfully

created

fuel

for

our

investments,

including

generating

industry-leading

Holistic

Margin

Management 

(HMM) cost savings by increasingly applying digital and technology capabilities throughout

our supply chain.

We 

successfully drove

strong cash

generation, with

free cash

flow conversion

finishing at

97 percent,

which was

above our 

full-year

target

of

95

percent.

This

enabled

us

to

fund

capital

investment,

raise

our

dividend,

and

continue

our

share 

repurchase activity. 

We 

also continued

to reshape our

portfolio, including

acquisitions and divestitures

that further

improved 

18 

our portfolio’s

ability to generate profitable growth

over the long term (see the

“Non-GAAP Measures” section below

for our 

use of this measure not defined by GAAP). 

A

detailed

review

of

our

fiscal

2025

performance

compared

to

fiscal

2024

appears

below

in

the

section

titled

“Fiscal

2025 

Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review

of our fiscal 2024 performance compared to our fiscal

2023 performance is set 

forth

in Part

II, Item

7 of

our Form

10-K for

the fiscal

year

ended

May 26, 2024

under the

caption

“Management’s

Discussion and 

Analysis of

Financial Condition

and Results

of Operations

– Fiscal

2024 Consolidated

Results of

Operations,” which

is incorporated 

herein by reference. 

In fiscal 2026, we

plan to continue advancing

our Accelerate strategy.

Our key priorities are to

return North America Retail

to volume 

growth,

Accelerate

North

America

Pet

growth

with

an

expanded

portfolio,

and

drive

efficiencies

to

reinvest

in

growth. 

We 

expect 

category

growth

to

be

below

our

long-term

projections,

reflecting

less

benefit

from

net price

realization

and

mix

amid

a

continued 

challenging

consumer

backdrop.

To

strengthen

our

categories

and

market

share

performance,

we

plan

to

increase

investment

in 

consumer

value,

product

news,

innovation,

and

brand

building,

guided

by

our

remarkable

experience

framework.

This

includes

a 

significant

strategic investment

to launch

Blue Buffalo

into the

fast-growing

U.S. fresh

pet food

sub-category

in calendar

2025\. 

We 

expect

the

combination

of

these

growth

investments,

input

cost

inflation,

and

a

reset

of

corporate

incentive

will

outpace

expected 

HMM cost savings of 5 percent of cost of

goods sold, savings from our global transformation

initiative, and benefits from a 53rd week 

in fiscal 2026.

In addition, we

expect the net

impact of the

divestiture of

our North American

yogurt businesses and

the Whitebridge 

Pet Brands acquisition will reduce adjusted operating profit growth

by approximately 5 points in fiscal 2026. 

Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2026 targets

are summarized below: 

●

Organic net sales are expected to range between down 1 percent and

up 1 percent. 

●

Adjusted operating profit

is expected to

be down 10

to 15 percent in

constant currency from

the base of

$3.4 billion reported 

in fiscal 2025. 

●

Adjusted diluted

EPS is

expected

to be

down 10

to 15

percent in

constant currency

from the

base of

$4.21 earned

in fiscal 

2025\. 

●

Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax

earnings.

use of measures not defined by GAAP.

fiscal 2025

decreased 2

percent compared

to fiscal 2024,

driven by

unfavorable organic

net price realization

and 

mix. 

Cost of

sales 

decreased $172 million

in fiscal

2025 to

$12,754 million. The

decrease was

primarily driven

by a

$95 million

decrease 

attributable to lower

volume and an $89

million decrease attributable

to product rate and mix.

We

recorded a $16 million

net decrease 

in cost of

sales related to

the mark-to-market valuation

of certain commodity

positions and grain

inventories in fiscal

2025, compared 

to a net decrease

of $39 million in

fiscal 2024 (please refer

decreased 30 basis points compared to fiscal 2024.

SG&A expenses

increased $187 million to

$3,446 million in fiscal 2025

compared to fiscal 2024

primarily driven by a

legal recovery 

in fiscal 2024, transaction

and integration costs recorded

in fiscal 2025 related to

the definitive agreements to

sell our North American 

yogurt businesses

and costs

related to

the Whitebridge

acquisition,

the addition

of a

2024,

and net recoveries

recorded in fiscal

2024 from the

products. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2025

increased 130 basis points compared to fiscal 2024. 

Divestitures

gain, net

totaled $96 million in fiscal 2025

related to the sale of our Canada yogurt business (please refer

to Note 3 to the 

Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).

Restructuring,

impairment,

and other

exit

costs 

totaled

$78

million in

fiscal 202

5

compared

to $241

million

in 

fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, we approved a multi-year global transformation

initiative to drive increased productivity by enhancing end-

to-end

business

processes,

enabled

by

targeted

organizational

actions,

and

as

a

result,

we

recorded

$70

million

of

charges

in

fiscal 

2025.

We

also recorded

$8 million

of restructuring

charges in

fiscal 2025

related to

actions previously

announced.

In fiscal 2024,

we 

recorded a

$117

million non-cash

goodwill impairment

charge

related to

our Latin

America reporting

unit and

$103 million

of non-

cash

impairment

charges

related

to

our 

Top

Chews

, 

True

Chews

,

and 

EPIC

brand

intangible

assets.

In

fiscal

2024,

we

approved 

restructuring

actions to

enhance the

go-to-market

commercial strategy

and associated

organizational

structure of

our North

America 

Pet segment,

and as

a result,

we recorded

$17 million

of charges

in fiscal

2024\. Please

refer to

Note 4

to the

Consolidated Financial 

Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Benefit

plan

non-service

income 

totaled

$54

million

in

fiscal

2025

compared

to

$76 million

in

fiscal

2024,

primarily

reflecting 

higher amortization

of losses

and higher

interest costs

(please refer

to Note

14 to

the Consolidated

Financial Statements

in Item

8 of 

this report for additional information). 

Interest,

net 

for fiscal

2025 totaled

$524 million, $45

million higher

than fiscal

2024, primarily

driven by

higher average

long-term 

debt levels. 

Our 

effective tax rate 

for fiscal 2025 was 20.2 percent compared

to 19.6 percent in fiscal 2024. The 0.6

percentage point increase was 

primarily driven

by certain nonrecurring

tax benefits in

fiscal 2024, partially

offset by favorable

earnings mix by

jurisdiction in fiscal 

2025\. Our

adjusted

effective

tax rate

was 20.6

percent in

fiscal 2025

compared

to 20.1

percent in

fiscal 2024

(see the

“Non-GAAP

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE

ITEMS 

Unallocated

certain

charitable

contributions,

restructuring

initiative project-related

costs,

gains and

losses on

corporate

investments,

results

from 

certain businesses managed by our Strategic Growth Office,

and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating 

performance. These

include gains and

losses arising from

the revaluation of

certain grain inventories

and gains and

losses from mark-

to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until

passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting

operating profit 

are

centrally

managed

at

the

corporate

level

and

are

excluded

from

the

measure

of

reviewed

by

executive

Under

organization,

our

manufacturing,

warehouse,

and

distribution

activities

are

substantially 

integrated

across

our

operations

in

order

to

maximize

efficiency

and

productivity.

As

a

result,

fixed

assets

and

depreciation

and 

amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating

segment. 

Unallocated corporate

expense totaled

$396 million

in fiscal 2025

,

compared to

$334 million

last year.

In fiscal

2024, we

recorded a 

$53

million

legal

recovery.

We

recorded

$49

million

of

transaction

costs

related

to

the

definitive

agreements

to

sell

our

North 

American yogurt businesses and the Whitebridge Pet Brands acquisition

in fiscal 2025, compared to $14 million of transaction costs in 

fiscal 2024, primarily

related to our

acquisition of a

pet food business

in Europe.

We

also recorded $14

million of integration

costs in 

fiscal 2025,

related to

the acquisition

of Whitebridge

Pet Brands

and the

acquisition of

a pet

food business

in Europe.

In fiscal

2024, 

we

recorded

$30

million

of

net recoveries

related

to

a

voluntary

recall

on

certain

international 

Häagen-Dazs

ice

cream

products

in 

fiscal 2023. We

recorded a $16 million net decrease in expense related to the mark-to-market

valuation of certain commodity positions 

and grain

inventories in fiscal

2025, compared

to a $39

million net decrease

in expense

last year.

In addition,

we recorded $8

million 

of net losses related to valuation adjustments in fiscal 2025,

compared to $18 million of net losses related to valuation

adjustments and 

the

sale

of

corporate

investments

in

fiscal

2024.

We

recorded

$9

of

restructuring

charges

and

$1

of

restructuring

costs

in

cost

of

in

fiscal

in

cost

of

in

fiscal

2024.

Certain

compensation

and

benefit

related

expenses 

decreased in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. 

IMPACT OF INFLATION 

We 

experienced broad-based global input cost inflation

of 4 percent in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. We

expect approximately 3 percent 

input cost inflation

in fiscal 2026

before the impact

of newly enacted

tariffs. We

expect the gross

risk of newly

enacted tariffs

to be 1 

to 2 percent

of cost of

goods sold, and

we are attempting

to mitigate tariff

risk through

various methods.

We

attempt to minimize

the 

effects

of

inflation

through

HMM,

Strategic

Revenue

Management

(SRM),

planning,

and

operating

practices.

Our

market

risk 

management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL

RESOURCES 

The primary source of our

liquidity is cash flow from

operations. Over the most recent

two-year period, our operations have

generated 

$6.2 billion

in cash.

A substantial

portion of

this operating

cash flow

has been

returned to

shareholders through

dividends and

share 

repurchases.

We

also

use

cash

from

operations

to

fund

our

capital

expenditures,

acquisitions,

and

debt

service.

We

typically

use

a 

combination

of

cash,

notes

payable,

and

long-term

debt,

and

occasionally

issue

shares

of

common

stock,

to

finance

significant 

acquisitions.

As of

May

25,

2025,

we had

$316

million

of cash

and

cash equivalents

held

in foreign

jurisdictions.

In

anticipation

of

repatriating 

funds

from

foreign

jurisdictions,

we

record

local

country

withholding

taxes

on

our

international

earnings,

as

applicable.

We

may 

repatriate our

cash and

cash equivalents

held by

our foreign

subsidiaries without

such funds

being subject

to further

U.S. income

tax 

liability. Earnings

prior to fiscal 2018 from our foreign subsidiaries remain permanently reinvested in

those jurisdictions.

were

in 

compliance with all of these covenants.

We have

$1,528 million of long-term debt maturing

in the next 12 months that

is classified as current, including

€500 million of 0.125 

percent fixed-rate notes due November 15, 2025,

€600 million of 0.45 percent fixed-rate notes due January

15, 2026, and €250 million 

28 

of

floating-rate

notes

due

April 22,

2026.

We

believe

that cash

flows

from

operations,

together

with available

short- and

long-term 

debt financing, will be adequate to meet our material contractual

obligations and overall liquidity and capital needs

for at least the next 

12 months. 

As of May

25, 2025,

our total debt,

including the

impact of derivative

instruments designated

as hedges,

was 74 percent

in fixed-rate 

and 26

percent in

floating-rate instruments,

compared to

85 percent

in fixed-rate

and 15

percent in

floating-rate instruments

on May 

26, 2024.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

For a complete description of our

significant accounting policies, please see Note

2 to the Consolidated Financial

Statements in Item 8 

of this report. Our critical accounting

estimates are those that have

a meaningful impact on the reporting of our

financial condition and 

results of operations.

These estimates include

our accounting for

revenue recognition, valuation

of long-lived assets,

intangible assets, 

income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,

and postemployment benefit plans. 

Revenue Recognition 

Our

revenues

are

reported

net

of

variable

consideration

and

consideration

payable

to

our

customers,

including

trade

promotion, 

consumer

coupon

redemption,

and

other

reductions

to

the

transaction

price,

including

estimated

allowances

for

returns,

unsalable 

product,

and

prompt

pay

discounts.

Trade

promotions

are

recorded

using

significant

judgment

of

estimated

participation

and 

performance levels

for offered

programs at the

time of sale.

Differences between

the estimated and

actual reduction to

the transaction 

price

are recognized

as a

change

in estimate

in a

subsequent

period.

Our accrued

trade and

coupon promotion

liabilities

were

$470 

million

as

of

May

25,

2025,

and

$425

million

as

of

May

26,

2024.

Because

these

amounts

are

significant,

if

our

estimates

are 

inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that

could have a significant effect on our results of operations. 

Valuation

of Long-Lived Assets

We

estimate

the useful

lives

of long

-lived

assets and

make

estimates concerning

undiscounted

cash flows

to review

for impairment 

whenever

events or

changes in

circumstances indicate

that the

carrying

amount of

an asset

(or asset

group)

may not

be recoverable. 

Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals,

as appropriate. 

Intangible Assets

Goodwill

and

other

indefinite-lived

intangible

assets

are

not

subject

to

amortization

and

are

tested

for

impairment

annually

and 

whenever

events or

changes in

circumstances

indicate

that impairment

may have

occurred. Our

estimates of

fair value

for

goodwill 

impairment

testing

are determined

based on

a

discounted

cash

flow

model.

We

use

inputs from

our

long-range

planning

process to 

determine

growth

rates

for

sales

and

profits.

We

also

make

estimates

of

discount

rates,

perpetuity

growth

assumptions,

market 

comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the

useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to

determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived.

Reaching a 

determination

on

useful

life

requires

significant

judgments

and

assumptions

regarding

the

future

effects

of

obsolescence,

demand, 

competition, other economic

factors (such as the

stability of the industry,

known technological advances,

legislative action that

results 

in an uncertain or

changing regulatory environment,

and expected changes in

distribution channels), the level

of required maintenance 

expenditures,

and

the

expected

lives

of

other

related

groups

of

assets.

Intangible

assets

that

are

deemed

to

have

finite

lives

are 

amortized

on a

straight-line basis

over their

useful lives,

generally

ranging from

4 to

30 years.

Our estimate

of the

fair value

of our 

brand

assets

is

based

on

a

discounted

cash

flow

model

using

inputs

which

include

projected

revenues

from

our

long-range

plan, 

assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount

rate.

As of

May

25,

2025,

we

had

$22 billion

of

goodwill

and

indefinite-lived

intangible

assets. While

we

currently

believe

that

the

fair 

value of each

intangible exceeds its carrying

value,

and that those intangibles

will contribute indefinitely

to our cash flows,

materially 

different

assumptions

regarding

future performance

of our

businesses

or

a different

weighted-average

cost

of capital

could

result

in 

material impairment losses

and amortization expense.

We

performed our fiscal

2025

assessment of our

intangible assets as of

the first 

day

of

the

second

quarter

of

fiscal

2025,

and

we

determined

there

was

no

impairment

of

our

intangible

assets

as

their

related

fair 

values

were

substantially

in

excess

of

the

carrying

values,

except

for

the 

Uncle

Toby’s

brand

intangible

asset.

In

addition,

while 

having

significant coverage

as of

our fiscal

2025 assessment

date, the 

Progresso

, 

Nudges

, 

True

Chews

, and 

Kitano

brand intangible 

assets had risk of decreasing coverage. We

will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment

. 

Income Taxes 

We

apply a more-likely-than-not

threshold to the

recognition and derecognition

of uncertain tax

positions. Accordingly,

we recognize 

the amount of

tax benefit that

has a greater

than 50 percent

likelihood of being

ultimately realized upon

settlement. Future

changes in 

judgment related

to the

expected ultimate

resolution of

uncertain tax

positions will

affect earnings

in the

period of

such change.

For 

more information on income taxes, please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial

Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

29 

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment

Benefit Plans 

We have

defined benefit pension plans covering

many employees in the United States,

Canada, Switzerland, and the United

Kingdom. 

We also

sponsor plans that provide

health care benefits to

many of our retirees

in the United States, Canada,

and Brazil. Under certain 

circumstances,

we

also

provide

accruable

benefits,

primarily

severance,

to

former

and

inactive

employees

in

the

United

States, 

Canada,

and

Mexico.

Please see

Note

14

to

the

Consolidated

Financial

Statements

in

Item

8

of

this

report

for

a

description

of

our 

defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment

benefit plans. 

We

recognize

benefits

provided

during

retirement

or

following

employment

over

the

plan

participants’

active

working

lives. 

Accordingly,

we

make

various

assumptions

to

predict

and

measure

costs

and

obligations

many

years

prior

to

the

settlement

of

our 

obligations.

Assumptions

that

require

significant

management

judgment

and

have

a material

impact

on

the

measurement

of

our

net 

periodic

benefit

expense

or

income

and

accumulated

benefit

obligations

include

the

long-term

rates

of

return

on

plan

assets,

the 

interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health

care cost trend rates. 

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

Our expected

rate of return

on plan assets

is determined

by our asset

allocation, our

historical long-term

investment performance,

our 

estimate of future long-term returns

by asset class (using input from our

actuaries, investment services, and investment

managers), and 

long-term inflation

assumptions. We

review this assumption

annually for

each plan; however,

our annual

investment performance

for 

one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 

Our

historical

investment

returns

(compound

annual

growth

rates)

for

our

United

States

defined

benefit

pension

and

other 

postretirement benefit

plan assets

were 4.0

percent in

the 1-year

period ended

May 25,

2025, and

returns of

0.2 percent,

4.3 percent, 

6.7 percent, and 6.2 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20-year periods ended

May 25, 2025. 

On a weighted

-average basis, the

expected rate

of return for

all defined

benefit plans

and other postretirement

plans was 7.63

percent 

and 7.79

percent for fiscal

2025, 7.13

percent and 7.34

percent for

fiscal 2024, and

6.70 percent and

6.76 percent for

fiscal 2023. For 

fiscal

2026,

we

decreased

our

weighted-average

expected

rate

of

return

on

plan

assets

due

to

an

increase

in

bond

asset

allocation 

policy for

our principal

defined benefit

pension and

other postretirement

plans in

the United

States to

7.60 percent

and 7.40

percent, 

respectively. 

Lowering

the

expected

long-term

rate

of

return

on

assets

by

100

basis

points

would

increase

our

net

pension

and

postretirement 

expense by $57 million for

fiscal 2026. A market-related

valuation basis is used to reduce

year-to-year expense volatility.

The market-

related valuation

recognizes certain

investment gains

or losses over

a five-year

period from

the year

in which

they occur.

Investment 

gains or

losses for

this purpose

are the difference

between the

expected return

calculated using

the market-related

value of

assets and 

the

actual

return

based

on

the

market-related

value

of

assets.

Our

outside

actuaries

perform

these

calculations

as

part

of

our 

determination of annual expense or income. 

Discount Rates 

We 

estimate

the

service

and

interest

cost

components

of

the

net

periodic

benefit

expense

for

our

United

States

and

most

of

our 

international

defined

benefit

pension,

other

postretirement

benefit,

and

postemployment

benefit

plans

utilizing

a

full

yield

curve 

approach

by applying

the specific

spot rates

along

the yield

curve used

to determine

the benefit

obligation

to the

relevant projected 

cash flows. Our

discount rate assumptions

are determined annually

as of May 31

for our defined

benefit pension, other

postretirement 

benefit,

and

postemployment

benefit

plan

obligations.

We

work

with

our

outside

actuaries

to

determine

the

timing

and

amount

of 

expected future cash outflows to plan

participants and, using the Aa Above Median

corporate bond yield, to develop a forward

interest 

rate curve, including

a margin to

that index based

on our credit

risk. This forward

interest rate curve

is applied to

our expected

future 

cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Lowering

basis

points

would

increase

our

net

defined

benefit

pension,

other

postretirement

benefit,

and 

postemployment benefit plan expense

for fiscal 2026 by approximately

$27 million. All obligation-related

experience gains and losses 

are amortized

using

a straight-line

method over

the average

remaining

service period

of active

plan participants

or over

the average 

remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or

almost all” inactive participants.

Health Care Cost Trend

Rates

We

review our

health care

cost trend

rates annually.

Our review

is based

on data

we collect

about our

health care

claims experience 

and information

provided by our

actuaries. This information

includes recent

plan experience,

plan design, overall

industry experience 

and projections, and

assumptions used by other

similar organizations.

Our initial health

care cost trend

rate is adjusted

as necessary to 

remain consistent

with this

review,

recent experiences,

and short-term

expectations.

Our initial

health care

cost trend

rate assumption 

is 7.9

percent for

retirees age

65 and

over and

7.9 percent

for retirees

under age

65 at

the end

of fiscal

2025\. Rates

are graded

down 

annually until

the ultimate

trend rate

of 4.5

percent is

reached in

2034 for

all retirees.

The trend

rates are

applicable for

calculations 

only if

the retirees’

benefits increase

as a

result of

health care

inflation. The

ultimate trend

rate is

adjusted annually,

as necessary,

to 

approximate

the

current

economic

view

on

the

rate

of

long-term

inflation

plus

an

appropriate

health

care

cost

premium.

Assumed 

trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the

amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. 

Any

arising

health

care

claims cost-related

experience

gain

or

loss is

recognized

in the

calculation

of expected

future claims.

Once 

recognized, experience gains and

losses are amortized using a straight-line

method over the average remaining

service period of active 

plan participants

or over

the average

remaining lifetime

of the

remaining plan

participants if

the plan

is viewed

as “all

or almost

all” 

inactive participants. 

Financial Statement Impact

In

fiscal

2025,

we

recorded

net

defined

benefit

pension,

other

postretirement

benefit,

and

postemployment

benefit

plan

expense

of 

$9 million

compared to

$11 million

of income

in fiscal

2024 and

$6 million

of income

in fiscal

2023.

As of

May 25,

2025,

we had 

cumulative unrecognized

actuarial net losses of

$2 billion on our

defined benefit pension plans

and cumulative unrecognized

actuarial 

net gains of

$209 million on our

postretirement and postemployment

benefit plans. These

net unrecognized actuarial

losses will result 

in

increases

in

our

future

net

pension

and

postretirement

benefit

expenses

because

they

currently

exceed

the

corridors

defined

by 

GAAP. 

Actual

future

net

defined

benefit

pension,

other

postretirement

benefit,

and

postemployment

benefit

plan

income

or

expense

will 

depend on

investment performance,

changes in

future discount

rates, changes

in health care

cost trend

rates, and

other factors

related 

to the populations participating in these plans. 

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting

Standards Board (FASB)

issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

2024-03 requiring 

additional

income statement

disclosures. The

ASU requires

the disaggregation

of specific

categories of

expenses underlying

the line 

items presented

on the

income statement.

Additionally,

the ASU

requires enhanced

disclosure of

selling expenses.

The requirements 

of the ASU are effective for annual periods

beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods

within fiscal years beginning after 

December

15,

2027.

For

us,

annual

reporting

requirements

will

be

effective

for

our

fiscal

2028

Form

10-K

and

interim

reporting 

requirements will be

effective beginning

with our first

quarter of fiscal

2029\. Early adoption

is permitted and

the amendments should 

be applied on a prospective

basis. Retrospective application is permitted. 

We 

are in the process of

analyzing the impact of the

ASU on 

our related disclosures.

31 

In

December

2023,

the

FASB

issued

ASU

2023-09

requiring

enhanced

income

tax

disclosures.

The

ASU

requires

disclosure

of 

specific

categories

and

disaggregation

of

information

in

the

rate

reconciliation

table.

The

ASU

also

requires

disclosure

of 

disaggregated

information

related

to

income

taxes

paid,

income

or

loss

from

continuing

operations

before

income

tax

expense

or 

benefit, and

income tax

expense or benefit

from continuing

operations. The

requirements of

the ASU are

effective for

annual periods 

beginning after December 15, 2024,

which for us is fiscal 2026.

Early adoption is permitted

and the amendments should be

applied on 

a prospective

basis. Retrospective

application is

permitted. 

We 

are in

the process

of analyzing

the impact

of the

ASU on

our related 

disclosures. 

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

We

have

included

in

this

report

measures

of

financial

performance

that

are not

defined

by

GAAP.

We

believe

that

these

measures 

provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other

communications to investors.

For each

of these

non-GAAP financial

measures, we

are providing

below a

reconciliation of

the differences

between the

non-GAAP 

measure and the most

directly comparable GAAP

measure, an explanation

of why we believe the

non-GAAP measure provides

useful 

information to

investors, and

any additional

material purposes

for which

our management

or Board

of Directors

uses the

non-GAAP 

measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition

to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 

Significant Items Impacting Comparability 

Several

measures

below

are

presented

on

an

adjusted

basis.

The

adjustments

are

either

items

resulting

from

infrequently

occurring 

events or items that, in management’s

judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year

assessment of operating results. 

The following are descriptions of significant items impacting comparability

of our results.

net of costs incurred. 

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates 

We 

provide organic

net sales

growth rates

for our

consolidated net

sales and

segment net

sales. This

measure is

used in

reporting to 

our

Board

of

Directors

and

executive

management

and

as

a

component

of

the

measurement

of

our

performance

for

incentive 

compensation

purposes. 

We 

believe that

organic net

sales growth

rates provide

useful information

to investors

because they

provide 

transparency

to underlying

performance

in our

net sales

by excluding

the effect

that foreign

currency

exchange rate

fluctuations,

as 

well

as

acquisitions,

divestitures,

and

a

53

rd

week,

when

applicable,

have

on

year-to-year

comparability.

A

reconciliation

of

these 

measures to reported

net sales growth

rates, the relevant

GAAP measures, are

included in our

Consolidated Results of

Operations and 

Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above.

Adjusted Operating Profit and Related Constant-currency Growth

Rate

This measure is used in reporting

to our Board of Directors and

executive management and as a

component of the measurement of

our 

performance for

incentive compensation purposes.

We

believe that

this measure provides

useful information

to investors because

it is 

the

operating

profit

measure

we

use

to

evaluate

operating

profit

performance

on

a

comparable

year-to-year

basis.

Additionally,

the 

measure

is

evaluated

on

a

constant-currency

basis

by

excluding

the

effect

that

foreign

currency

exchange

rate

fluctuations

have

on 

year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign

currency exchange rates.

Our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated

Forward-Looking Financial Measures 

Our fiscal

2026 outlook

for organic

net sales

growth, constant-currency

adjusted operating

profit and

adjusted diluted

EPS, and

free 

cash

flow

conversion

are

non-GAAP

financial

measures

that

exclude,

or

have

otherwise

been

adjusted

for,

items

impacting 

comparability,

including

the

effect

of

foreign

currency

exchange

rate

fluctuations,

restructuring

and

transformation

charges, 

acquisition

transaction

and

integration costs,

acquisitions,

divestitures,

mark-to-market

effects,

and

a 53rd

week. 

We 

are not

able to 

reconcile

these

forward-looking

non-GAAP

financial

measures

to

their

most

directly

comparable

forward-looking

GAAP

financial 

measures

without

unreasonable

efforts

because

we

are

unable

to

predict

with

a

reasonable

degree

of

certainty

the

actual

impact

of 

changes

in

foreign

currency

exchange

rates

and

commodity

prices

or

the

timing

or

impact

of

acquisitions,

divestitures,

and 

restructuring

and transformation

actions throughout

fiscal 2026.

The unavailable

information could

have a

significant impact

on our 

fiscal 2026 GAAP financial results.

38 

For fiscal 2026, we

currently expect: the net impact

from foreign currency exchange

rates (based on a blend

of forward and forecasted 

rates and hedge

positions), acquisitions and

divestitures completed

prior to fiscal

2026 and those

expected to close

in fiscal 2026,

and 

a 53rd week

to reduce net

sales growth by

approximately 4 percent;

foreign currency

exchange rates to

have an immaterial

impact on 

adjusted

operating

profit

and

adjusted

diluted

EPS

growth;

and

restructuring

and

transformation

charges

and

transaction

and 

acquisition integration costs related to actions previously announced

to total approximately $90 million to $95 million. 

ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We

are

exposed

to

market

risk

stemming

from

changes

in

interest

and

foreign

exchange

rates

and

commodity

and

equity

prices. 

Changes

in

these

factors

could

cause

fluctuations

in

our

earnings

and

cash

flows.

In

the

normal

course

of

business,

we

actively 

manage

our

exposure

to

these market

risks

by entering

into various

hedging

transactions,

authorized

under

established

policies

that 

place controls

on these

activities. The

counterparties

in these

transactions are

generally

highly rated

institutions. We

establish

credit 

limits for

each counterparty.

Our hedging

transactions include

but are

not limited

to a variety

of derivative

financial instruments.

For 

information

on

interest

rate,

foreign

exchange,

commodity

price,

and

equity

instrument

risk,

please

see

Note

to

the

Consolidated 

Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

VALUE

AT RISK 

The

estimates

in

the

table below

are

intended

to measure

the

maximum

potential

fair value

we

could

lose

in one

day

from

adverse 

changes

in

market

interest

rates,

foreign

exchange

rates,

commodity

prices,

and

equity

prices

under

normal

market

conditions. 

A 

Monte Carlo

value-at-risk (VAR)

methodology was

used to

quantify the

market risk

for our

exposures. The

models assumed

normal 

market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. 

The

VAR

calculation

used

historical

interest

and

foreign

exchange

rates,

and

commodity

and

equity

prices

from

the

past

year

to 

estimate the

potential volatility

and correlation

of these

rates in

the future.

The market

data were

drawn from

the RiskMetrics™

data 

set.

The

calculations

are

not

intended

to

represent

actual

losses

in

fair

value

that

we

expect

to

incur.

Further,

since

the

hedging 

instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates

with the underlying exposure, we would

expect that any loss or gain in the fair

value of 

our

derivatives

would

be

generally

offset

by

an

increase

or

decrease

in

the

fair

value

of

the

underlying

exposure.

The

positions 

included

in the

calculations were:

debt; investments;

interest rate

swaps; foreign

exchange forwards;

commodity swaps,

futures, and 

options; and

equity instruments.

The calculations

do not

include the

underlying foreign

exchange and

commodities or

equity-related 

positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below

presents the estimated maximum

potential VAR

arising from a

one-day loss in

fair value for

our interest rate, foreign 

currency, commodity,

and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 25,

2025\.

General Mills, Inc.: 

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control

Over Financial Reporting 

We

have

audited

the

accompanying

consolidated

balance

sheets

of

General

Mills,

Inc. and

subsidiaries

(the

Company)

as

of 

May 25, 2025, and May 26,

2024, the related consolidated

statements of earnings, comprehensive

income, total equity,

and cash flows 

for

each

of

the

fiscal

years

in

the

three-year

period

ended

May 25, 2025,

and

the

related

notes

and

financial

statement

schedule

II 

(collectively,

the consolidated

financial statements).

We

also have

audited the

Company’s

internal control

over financial

reporting as 

of

May 25, 2025,

based

on

criteria

established

in 

Internal

Control

–

Integrated

Framework

(2013)

issued

by

the

Committee

of 

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway

Commission. 

In our

opinion, the

consolidated financial

statements referred

to above

present fairly,

in all material

respects, the

financial position

of 

the Company as

of May 25, 2025, and

May 26, 2024,

and the results of

its operations and

its cash flows for

each of the fiscal

years in 

the three-year

period ended May 25,

2025, in conformity

with U.S. generally

accepted accounting

principles. Also in

our opinion,

the 

Company maintained,

in all material

respects, effective

internal control

over financial

reporting as of

May 25, 2025, based

on criteria 

established

in 

Internal

Control

–

Integrated

Framework

(2013)

issued

by

the

Committee

of

Organizations

of

the 

Treadway Commission. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company’s

management is responsible

for these consolidated

financial statements, for

maintaining effective

internal control over 

financial

reporting,

and

for

its

assessment

of

the

effectiveness

of

internal

control

over

financial

reporting,

included

in

the 

accompanying Management's

Report on

Internal Control

over Financial

Reporting. Our

responsibility is

to express

an opinion

on the 

Company’s

consolidated financial

statements and an

opinion on

the Company’s

internal control

over financial reporting

based on

our 

audits. We

are a

public accounting

firm registered

with the

Public Company

Accounting Oversight

Board (United

States) (PCAOB) 

and are required to

be independent with

respect to the Company

in accordance with the

U.S. federal securities laws

and the applicable 

rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted

our audits in accordance with the

standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require

that we plan and perform the audits 

to obtain

reasonable assurance

about whether

the consolidated

financial statements

are free

of material

misstatement, whether

due to 

error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial

reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of

the consolidated financial

statements included performing

procedures to assess

the risks of

material misstatement

of the 

consolidated

financial

statements,

whether

due

to

error

or

fraud,

and

performing

procedures

that

respond

to

those

risks.

Such 

procedures

included

examining,

on

a

test

basis,

evidence

regarding

the

amounts

and

disclosures

in

the

consolidated

financial 

statements. Our audits also included

evaluating the accounting principles

used and significant estimates made

by management, as well 

as evaluating

the overall

presentation

of the

consolidated

financial

statements.

Our

audit of

internal

control over

financial

reporting 

included obtaining an understanding

of internal control over financial

reporting, assessing the risk that

a material weakness exists,

and 

testing and

evaluating the

design and

operating effectiveness

of internal

control based

on the

assessed risk.

Our audits

also included 

performing

such other

procedures as

we considered

necessary in

the circumstances.

We

believe that

our audits

provide a

reasonable 

basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control

Over Financial Reporting 

A company’s

internal control over financial reporting is a

process designed to provide reasonable assurance

regarding the reliability of 

financial reporting and

the preparation of

financial statements for

external purposes in

accordance with generally

accepted accounting 

principles.

A

company’s

internal

control

over

financial

reporting

includes

those

policies

and

procedures

that

(1)

pertain

to

the 

maintenance

of

records

that,

in

reasonable

detail,

accurately

and

fairly

reflect

the

transactions

and

dispositions

of

the

assets

of

the 

company; (2) provide

reasonable assurance that

transactions are recorded

as necessary to permit

preparation of financial

statements in 

accordance with

generally accepted

accounting principles,

and that

receipts and

expenditures of

the company

are being

made only

in 

accordance

with

authorizations

of

management

and

directors

of

the

company;

and

(3)

provide

reasonable

assurance

regarding 

prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or

disposition of the company’s

assets that could have a material effect 

on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent

limitations, internal control

over financial reporting may

not prevent or detect

misstatements. Also, projections 

of any evaluation

of effectiveness to

future periods are

subject to the

risk that controls

may become inadequate

because of changes

in 

conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures

may deteriorate. 

42 

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter

communicated below is a

matter arising from the

current period audit of the

consolidated financial statements 

that was communicated

or required to

be communicated to

the audit committee

and that: (1) relates

to accounts or

disclosures that are 

material to

the consolidated

financial statements

and (2)

involved our

especially challenging,

subjective, or

complex judgments.

The 

communication

of

a

critical

audit matter

does

not

alter

in any

way

our

opinion

on the

consolidated

financial

statements, taken

as a 

whole, and

we are

not, by

communicating the

critical audit

matter below,

providing a

separate opinion

on the

critical audit

matter or 

on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Valuation

of goodwill and brand intangible assets 

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill

and brands and other indefinite-lived intangibles 

balances

as

of

May

25,

2025,

were

$15,622.4

million

and

$6,816.7

million,

respectively.

The

impairment

tests

for

these 

assets, which

are performed

annually and

whenever

events or

changes in

circumstances

indicate that

impairment may

have 

occurred, require

the Company

to estimate

the fair

value of

the reporting

units to

which goodwill

is assigned

as well

as the 

brands and

other indefinite

-lived intangible

assets. The

fair value

estimates are

derived

from discounted

cash flow

analyses 

that

require

the

Company

to make

judgments

about

highly subjective

matters,

including

future

operating

results,

including 

revenue growth rates and operating margins,

and an estimate of the discount rates and royalty rates. 

We

identified the

assessment of the

valuation of certain

goodwill and

brand intangible assets

as a critical

audit matter.

There 

was

a

significant

degree

of

judgment

required

in

evaluating

audit

evidence,

which

consists

primarily

of

forward-looking 

assumptions

about

future

operating

results,

specifically

the

revenue

growth

rates

and

operating

margins,

royalty

rates

and 

subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates. 

The

following

are

the

primary

procedures

we

performed

to address

this critical

audit

matter.

We

evaluated

the

design

and 

tested

the

operating

effectiveness

of

internal

controls

related

to

the valuation

of goodwill

and

brand

intangible

assets. This 

included controls related

to the assumptions

about future operating

results and the discount

and royalty rates

used to measure 

the fair

value of

the reporting

units and

brand intangible

assets. We

performed

sensitivity analyses

over the

revenue growth 

rates, operating margins, brand

royalty rates and discount rates

to assess the impact of

other points within a range

of potential 

assumptions.

We

evaluated

the

revenue

growth

rates

and

operating

margin

assumptions

by

comparing

them

to

recent 

financial performance

and external

market and

industry data.

We

evaluated whether

these assumptions

were consistent

with 

evidence obtained

in other areas

of the audit.

We

involved professionals with

specialized skills and

knowledge, who assisted 

in

the

evaluation

of

certain

of the

Company’s

assumptions

including

discount

rate,

by

comparing

them

against

rate

ranges 

that

were

independently

developed

using

publicly

available

market

data

for

comparable

entities

and

the

royalty

rates,

by 

evaluating the methods, assumptions and market data used to estimate the royalty

rates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

GENERAL MILLS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

AND RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Basis of Presentation 

Our Consolidated Financial

Statements include the

accounts of General

Mills, Inc. and all

subsidiaries in which

we have a controlling 

financial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated

in consolidation. 

Our fiscal year

ends on the

last Sunday in

May.

Our India business

is on an

April fiscal year

end. In addition,

the consolidated results 

of certain recent acquisitions are reported on a one-month lag. Please see Note 3 for

more information. 

Certain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information

have been made to conform to the current period 

presentation.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all investments

purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Inventories

All

inventories

in

the

United

States

other

than

grain

are

valued

at

the

lower

of

cost,

using

the

last-in,

first-out

(LIFO)

method,

or 

market. Grain inventories are

valued at net realizable

value, and all related cash

contracts and derivatives are valued

at fair value, with 

all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently. 

Inventories

outside

of the

United

States are

generally

valued

at

the lower

of

cost, using

the

first-in,

first-out

(FIFO) method,

or net 

realizable value. 

Shipping

costs associated

with the

distribution of

finished product

to our

customers are

recorded as

cost of

sales and

are recognized 

when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.

Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation

Land is recorded at historical cost.

Buildings and equipment, including

capitalized interest and internal engineering

costs, are recorded 

at

cost

and

depreciated

over

estimated

useful

lives,

primarily

using

the

straight-line

method.

Ordinary

maintenance

and

repairs

are 

charged

to

cost

of

sales.

Buildings

are

usually

depreciated

over 

40

years,

and

equipment,

furniture,

and

software

are

usually 

depreciated over 

3

to 

10

years. Fully depreciated assets are retained

in buildings and equipment until disposal.

When an item is sold or 

retired,

the

accounts

are

relieved

of

its

cost

and

related

accumulated

depreciation

and

the

resulting

gains

and

losses,

if

any,

are 

recognized in earnings.

Long-lived assets

are reviewed

for impairment

whenever events

or changes

in circumstances

indicate that

the carrying

amount of

an 

asset

(or

asset

group)

may

not

be

recoverable.

An

impairment

loss

would

be

recognized

when

estimated

undiscounted

future

cash 

flows from

the operation

and disposition

of the

asset group

are less

than the

carrying amount

of the

asset group.

Asset groups

have 

identifiable cash

flows and

are largely

independent of

other asset groups.

Measurement of

an impairment

loss would

be based

on the 

excess

of

the

carrying

amount of

the

asset group

over

its fair

value.

Fair

value

is measured

using

a discounted

cash

flow model

or 

independent appraisals, as appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

is

not

subject

to

amortization

and

is

tested

for

impairment

annually

and

whenever

events

or

changes

in

circumstances 

indicate that impairment may have

occurred. We

perform our annual goodwill and

indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment

test as 

of the

first day

of the

second quarter

of the

fiscal year.

Impairment testing

is performed

for each

of our

reporting units.

We

compare 

the

carrying

value

of

a

reporting

unit,

including

goodwill,

to

the

fair

value

of

the

unit.

Carrying

value

is

based

on

the

assets

and 

liabilities

associated

with

the

operations

of

that

reporting

unit,

which

often

requires

allocation

of

shared

or

corporate

items

among 

reporting

units.

If

the

carrying

amount

of

a

reporting

unit

exceeds

its

fair

value,

impairment

has

occurred.

We

recognize

an 

impairment charge

for the

amount by

which the carrying

amount of

the reporting

unit exceeds

its fair

value up

to the

total amount

of 

goodwill allocated

to the

reporting unit.

Our estimates

of fair

value are

determined based

on a

discounted

cash flow

model. Growth 

rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range

planning process. We also make

estimates of discount rates, 

perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.

We evaluate the

useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to

determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived.

Reaching a 

determination

on

useful

life

requires

significant

judgments

and

assumptions

regarding

the

future

effects

of

obsolescence,

demand, 

competition, other economic

factors (such as the

stability of the industry,

known technological advances,

legislative action that

results 

49 

in an uncertain or

changing regulatory environment,

and expected changes in

distribution channels), the level

of required maintenance 

expenditures,

and

the

expected

lives

of

other

related

groups

of

assets.

Intangible

assets

that

are

deemed

to

have

finite

lives

are 

amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging

from 

4

to 

30

years. 

Our

indefinite-lived

intangible

assets,

mainly

intangible

assets

primarily

associated

with

the 

Blue

Buffalo

,

Pillsbury

,

Totino’s

,

Progresso

,

Old

El

Paso

,

Tiki

Pets

,

Annie’s

,

Nudges

,

Edgard

&

Cooper

,

and

Häagen-Dazs

brands,

are

also

tested

for

impairment 

annually and

whenever events

or changes

in circumstances

indicate that

their carrying

value may

not be recoverable.

Our estimate

of 

the fair

value of

the brands

is based

on a

discounted cash

flow model

using inputs

which included

projected revenues

from our

long-

range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own

the brands, and a discount rate.

Our finite-lived intangible

assets, primarily acquired

customer relationships, are

reviewed for impairment

whenever events or changes 

in circumstances indicate

that the carrying amount

of an asset may not

be recoverable. An impairment

loss would be recognized

when 

estimated undiscounted future cash

flows from the operation and disposition

of the asset are less than the

carrying amount of the asset. 

Assets generally

have identifiable

cash flows

and are

largely independent

of other

assets. Measurement

of an

impairment loss

would 

be

based on

the

excess of

the carrying

amount of

the asset

over

its fair

value.

Fair

value

is measured

using

a discounted

cash

flow 

model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.

Leases 

We

determine whether

an arrangement

is a lease

at inception.

When our

lease arrangements

include lease and

non-lease components, 

we account for lease and non-lease components (e.g.,

common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.

Any

lease

arrangements

with

an

initial

term

of

12

months

or

less

are

not

recorded

on

our

Consolidated

Balance

Sheets,

and

we 

recognize lease costs for these

lease arrangements on a straight-line

basis over the lease term. Many

of our lease arrangements provide 

us with

options to

exercise one

or more

renewal terms

or to

terminate the

lease arrangement.

We

include these

options when

we are 

reasonably certain

to exercise them

in the lease

term used to

establish our

right of use

assets and lease

liabilities. Generally,

our lease 

agreements do not include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees,

or material restrictive covenants. 

We

have

certain

lease

arrangements

with

variable

rental

payments.

Our

lease

arrangements

for

our

Häagen-Dazs

retail

shops

often 

include rental payments

that are based

on a percentage

of retail sales. We

have other lease

arrangements that are

adjusted periodically 

based on

an inflation

index or rate.

The future

variability of these

payments and

adjustments are

unknown, and

therefore they

are not 

included

as

minimum

lease

payments

used

to

determine

our

right

of

use

assets

and

lease

liabilities.

Variable

rental

payments

are 

recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

As

most

of

our

lease

arrangements

do

not

provide

an

implicit

interest

rate,

we

apply

an

incremental

borrowing

rate

based

on

the 

information available at the commencement date of the lease arrangement

to determine the present value of lease payments.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

Our

investments

in

companies

over

which

we

have

the

ability

to

exercise

significant

influence

are

stated

at

cost

plus

our

share

of 

undistributed

earnings

or

losses.

We

receive

royalty

income

from

certain

joint

ventures,

incur

various

expenses

(primarily

research 

and

development),

and

record

the

tax

impact

of

certain

joint

venture

operations

that

are

structured

as

partnerships.

In

addition,

we 

make

advances

to

our

joint

ventures

in

the

form

of

loans

or

capital

investments.

We

also

sell

certain

raw

materials,

semi-finished 

goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices. 

In addition,

we assess our

investments in our

joint ventures if

we have reason

to believe an

impairment may have

occurred including, 

but not

limited to,

as a

result of

ongoing operating

losses, projected

decreases in

earnings, increases

in the

weighted-average

cost of 

capital,

or

significant

business

disruptions.

The

significant

assumptions

used

to

estimate

fair

value

include

revenue

growth

and 

profitability,

royalty

rates,

capital

spending,

depreciation

and

taxes,

foreign

currency

exchange

rates,

and

a

discount

rate.

By

their 

nature, these projections

and assumptions are uncertain.

If we were to

determine the current

fair value of our

investment was less than 

the carrying value of

the investment, then we

would assess if the

shortfall was of a temporary

or permanent nature and

write down the 

investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.

Revenue Recognition

Our revenues primarily result

from contracts with customers,

which are generally short-term

and have a single performance

obligation 

– the

delivery of

product. We

recognize revenue

for the

sale of packaged

foods at the

point in

time when our

performance obligation 

has been satisfied and control of the

product has transferred to our customer,

which generally occurs when the shipment

is accepted by 

our customer.

Sales include

shipping and

handling charges

billed to

the customer

and are

reported

net of

variable consideration

and 

consideration

payable

to

our

customers,

including

trade

promotion,

consumer

coupon

redemption

and

other

reductions

to

the 

transaction

price,

including

estimated allowances

for

returns, unsalable

product,

and

prompt

pay

discounts.

Sales, use,

value-added, 

and

other

excise

taxes

are

not

included

in

revenue.

Trade

promotions

are

recorded

using

significant

judgment

of

estimated 

participation and

performance levels

for offered

programs at

the time

of sale.

Differences between

estimated and

actual reductions

to 

the

transaction

price

are

recognized

as

a

change

in

estimate

in

a

subsequent

period.

We

generally

do

not

allow

a

right

of

return. 

50 

However,

on a

limited case-by-case

basis with

prior

approval, we

may

allow customers

to return

product. In

limited circumstances, 

product

returned

in

saleable

condition

is

resold

to

other

customers

or

outlets.

Receivables

from

customers

generally

do

not

bear 

interest. Payment terms and

collection patterns vary around

the world and by

channel, and are short-term,

and as such, we do

not have 

any significant financing components.

Our allowance for doubtful

accounts represents our estimate of

expected credit losses related

to 

our

trade

receivables.

We

pool

our

trade

receivables

based

on

similar

risk

characteristics,

such

as

geographic

location,

business 

channel, and other

account data. To

estimate our allowance

for doubtful

accounts, we leverage

information on historical

losses, asset-

specific

risk

characteristics,

current

conditions,

and reasonable

and

supportable

forecasts of

future

conditions.

Account

balances

are 

written off

against the

allowance when

we deem

the amount

is uncollectible.

Please see

Note 17

for a

disaggregation of

our revenue 

into

categories

that

depict

how

the

nature,

amount,

timing,

and

uncertainty

of

revenue

and

cash

flows

are

affected

by

economic 

factors. We do

not have material contract assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers.

Environmental Costs

Environmental costs

relating to

existing conditions

caused by

past operations

that do

not contribute

to current

or future

revenues are 

expensed. Liabilities

for anticipated

remediation costs

are recorded

on an

undiscounted basis

when they

are probable

and reasonably 

estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment

to a plan of action.

Advertising Production Costs

We expense the

production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and Development

All expenditures for research and development

(R&D) are charged against earnings in the period

incurred. R&D includes expenditures 

for

new

product

and

manufacturing

process

innovation,

and

the

annual

expenditures

are

comprised

primarily

of

internal

salaries, 

wages, consulting, and supplies

attributable to R&D activities.

Other costs include depreciation

and maintenance of research

facilities, 

including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.

Foreign Currency Translation

For

all

significant

foreign

operations,

the

functional

currency

is

the

local

currency.

Assets

and

liabilities

of

these

operations

are 

translated

at

the

period-end

exchange

rates.

Income

statement

accounts

are

translated

using

the

average

exchange

rates

prevailing 

during the period. Translation

adjustments are reflected within

accumulated other comprehensive

loss (AOCI) in stockholders’

equity. 

Gains

and

losses

from

foreign

currency

transactions

are

included

in

net

earnings

for

the

period,

except

for

gains

and

losses

on 

investments

in

subsidiaries

for

which

settlement

is not

planned

for

the foreseeable

future and

foreign

exchange

gains and

losses

on 

instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded

in AOCI.

Derivative Instruments

All derivatives are recognized

on our Consolidated

Balance Sheets at fair

value based on quoted

market prices or our

estimate of their 

fair value,

and are

recorded in

either current

or noncurrent

assets or

liabilities based

on their

maturity.

Changes in

the fair

values of 

derivatives are

recorded in

net earnings

or other

comprehensive income,

based on

whether the

instrument is

designated and

effective 

as

a

hedge

transaction

and,

if

so,

the

type

of

hedge

transaction.

Gains

or

losses

on

derivative

instruments

reported

in

AOCI

are 

reclassified

to

earnings

in

the

period

the

hedged

item

affects

earnings.

If

the

underlying

hedged

transaction

ceases

to

exist,

any 

associated amounts

reported

in AOCI

are reclassified

to earnings

at that

time. Cash

flows from

derivative

instruments are

primarily 

reported in cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated

Statements of Cash Flows.

Stock-based Compensation

We generally

measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock

units and performance share units using the value of

a share 

of

our

stock

on

the

date

of

grant.

We

estimate

the

value

of

stock

option

grants

using

a

Black-Scholes

valuation

model.

Generally, 

stock-based

compensation

is recognized

straight

line over

the

vesting

period.

Our stock-based

compensation

expense is

recorded

in 

selling, general

,

and administrative

(SG&A) expenses

and cost

of sales

in our

Consolidated Statements

of Earnings

and allocated

to 

each reportable segment in our segment results. 

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions

that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination,

or death of 

eligible

employees

and

directors.

We

consider

a

stock-based

award

to

be vested

when

the employee’s

or

director’s

retention

of

the 

award

is

no

longer

contingent

on

providing

subsequent

service.

Accordingly,

the

related

compensation

cost

for

awards

granted

to 

retirement-eligible individuals is recognized from the grant date over

an accelerated stated vesting period. 

We report the

benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating

cash flow.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment

Benefit Plans

We

sponsor

several domestic

and foreign

defined

benefit plans

to provide

pension, health

care, and

other welfare

benefits to

retired 

employees. Under

certain circumstances,

we also

provide accruable

benefits, primarily

severance, to

former or

inactive employees

in 

the

United

States,

Canada,

and

Mexico.

We

recognize

an

obligation

for

any

of

these

benefits

that

vest

or

accumulate

with

service. 

51 

Postemployment benefits

that do not

vest or

accumulate with

service (such

as severance

based solely

on annual pay

rather than

years 

of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment

benefit plans are unfunded. 

We

recognize the underfunded

or overfunded status

of a defined

benefit pension plan

as an asset

or liability and

recognize changes

in 

the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.

Use of Estimates

Preparing

our

Consolidated

Financial

Statements

in

conformity

with

accounting

principles

generally

accepted

in

the

United

States 

requires

us to

make estimates

and assumptions

that affect

reported amounts

of assets

and

liabilities, disclosures

of contingent

assets 

and liabilities

at the

date of

the financial

statements, and

the reported

amounts of

revenues and

expenses during

the reporting

period. 

These

estimates

include

our

accounting

for

revenue

recognition,

valuation

of

long-lived

assets, intangible

assets,

income

taxes,

and 

defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment

benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our

estimates.

New Accounting Standards

In the

fourth quarter

of fiscal

2025,

we adopted

new accounting

requirements

related

to enhanced

segment disclosure

requirements. 

The

new

standard

requires

disclosure

of

significant

segment

expenses

regularly

provided

to

the

chief

operating

decision

maker 

(CODM) included within segment

operating profit or loss

as well as a description

of how the CODM utilizes

segment operating profit 

or loss to assess segment performance.

We adopted

the requirements of the new standard using

a retrospective approach. The adoption 

of

this

accounting

guidance

did

not

have

a

material

impact

on

our

results

of

operations

and

financial

position.

See

Note

17

to

the 

consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the

impact to our related disclosure. 

In

the

first

quarter

of

fiscal

2024,

we

adopted

new

requirements

for

enhanced

disclosures

related

to

supplier

financing

programs, 

except for the rollforward

requirement, which we adopted

in the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2025. The new

standard requires disclosure of 

the key terms

of the program and

a rollforward of

the related obligation

during the annual

period, including the

amount of obligations 

confirmed

and

obligations

subsequently

paid.

We

have

historically

presented

the

key

terms

of

these

programs

and

the

associated 

obligation

outstanding.

The

adoption

of

this

guidance

did

not

have

a

material

impact

on

our

results

of

operations

and

financial 

position. See Note 8 to the consolidated Financial Statements for additional

information on the impact to our related disclosure. 

In the first quarter

of fiscal 2024, we

adopted optional accounting guidance

to ease the burden

in accounting for reference

rate reform. 

The new

standard provides

temporary expedients

and exceptions

to existing

accounting requirements

for contract

modifications

and 

hedge

accounting

related

to transitioning

from

discounted

reference

rates. This

resulted

in

modifying

contracts,

where necessary,

to 

apply a new reference rate,

primarily SOFR. The adoption of

this accounting guidance did not

have a material impact on our results

of 

operations and financial position.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

During

the

third

quarter

of

fiscal

2025,

we

acquired

NX

Pet

Holding,

Inc.,

representing

Whitebridge

Pet

Brands’

North

American 

premium cat feeding

and pet treating

business, for a

purchase price of

$

1.4

billion (Whitebridge Pet

Brands acquisition). We

financed 

the transaction

with cash

on hand

and new

debt. We

consolidated Whitebridge

Pet Brands

into our

Consolidated Balance

Sheets and 

recorded goodwill of

$

1,086.7

million, an indefinite-lived

intangible asset for

the 

Tiki Pets

brand totaling $

289.0

million, and a finite-

lived customer

relationship asset

of $

31.0

million. The

goodwill is

included in

the North

America Pet

segment and

is not

deductible 

for tax

purposes. The

pro forma effects

of this acquisition

were not material.

We

have conducted

a preliminary

assessment of

the fair 

value

of the

acquired

assets and

liabilities of

the business

and

we are

continuing our

review of

these items

during

the measurement 

period.

If

new

information

is obtained

about

facts

and

circumstances

that

existed

at

the

acquisition

date,

the

acquisition

accounting 

will

be

revised

to

reflect

the

resulting

adjustments

to

current

estimates

of

those

items.

The

consolidated

results

are

reported

in

our 

North America Pet operating segment on a one-month lag. 

During

the

second

quarter

of

fiscal

2025,

we

entered

into

definitive

agreements

to

sell

our

North

American

yogurt

businesses

to 

affiliates of Groupe Lactalis S.A. (Lactalis) and

Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) for approximately $

2.1

billion. During the third quarter 

of

fiscal

2025,

we

completed

the

sale

of

our

Canada

yogurt

business

to

Sodiaal

and

recorded

a

pre-tax

gain

of

$

95.9

million. 

Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2025, the regulatory review for the

sale of our United States yogurt business to Lactalis was completed, 

and

the

transaction

was

cleared

to

close

subject

to

completion

of

other

customary

closing

conditions.

We

expect

to

close

the 

transaction and

record a

pre-tax gain

on the

sale of

this business in

the first

quarter of

fiscal 2026.

We

have classified

relevant assets 

and

liabilities

associated

with

our

United

States yogurt

business as

held

for

sale in

our Consolidated

Balance

Sheets

as of

May

25, 

2025\.

During the fourth quarter

of fiscal 2024, we acquired

a pet food business in Europe,

for a purchase price of $

434.1

million, net of cash 

acquired.

During

the

first

quarter

of

fiscal

2025,

we

paid

$

7.7

million

related

to

a

purchase price

holdback

after closing

conditions 

were

met.

We

financed

the

transaction

with

cash

on

hand. We

consolidated

the

business

into

our

Consolidated

Balance Sheets

and 

recorded

goodwill

of

$

317.5

million,

an

indefinite-lived

brand

intangible

asset

of

$

118.4

million

and

a

finite-lived

customer 

relationship asset

of $

14.2

million. The

goodwill is

included in

the International

segment and

is not

deductible for

tax purposes.

The 

pro forma effects

of this acquisition were

not material. The consolidated

results are reported

in our International operating

segment on 

a one-month lag.

During

the first

quarter

of fiscal

2023,

we

acquired

TNT Crust,

a

manufacturer

of high-quality

frozen pizza

crusts

for

regional

and 

national pizza

chains, foodservice

distributors, and

retail outlets,

for a

purchase price

of $

253.0

million. We

financed the

transaction 

with U.S. commercial paper.

We consolidated

the TNT Crust business into

our Consolidated Balance Sheets

and recorded goodwill of 

$

156.7

million. The

goodwill is

included in

the North

America Foodservice

segment and

is not

deductible for

tax purposes.

The pro 

forma effects of this acquisition were not material.

During the

first quarter

of fiscal

2023,

we completed

the sale

of our

Helper main

meals and

Suddenly

Salad side

dishes business

to 

Eagle Family Foods Group for $

606.8

million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $

442.2

million.

NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING,

TRANSFORMATION,

IMPAIRMENT,

AND OTHER EXIT COSTS

INTANGIBLE ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS 

In fiscal 2024, we

recorded a $

117.1

million non-cash goodwill impairment

charge related to

our Latin America reporting

unit. Please 

see Note 6 for additional information. 

In fiscal

2024, we

recorded $

103.1

million of

non-cash impairment

charges related

to our 

Top

Chews

, 

True

Chews

,

and 

EPIC

brand 

intangible assets. Please see Note 6 for additional information.

RESTRUCTURING AND TRANSFORMATION

INITIATIVES 

We 

view our

restructuring

and transformation

activities as

actions that

help us

meet our

long-term

growth

targets

and are

evaluated 

against internal

rate of

return and

net present

value targets.

Each project

normally takes

one to

two years

to complete.

At completion 

(or

as each

major

stage

is completed

in

the case

of multi-year

programs),

the project

begins

to

deliver

cash

savings and/or

reduced 

depreciation. These activities result

in various restructuring and

transformation costs, including asset

write-offs, exit charges

including 

severance,

contract

termination

fees,

and

decommissioning

and

other

costs.

Accelerated

depreciation

associated

with

restructured 

assets, as

used in

the context

of our

disclosures regarding

restructuring activity,

refers to

the increase

in depreciation

expense caused 

by shortening the

useful life or

updating the salvage

value of depreciable

fixed assets to

coincide with the

end of production

under an

In

we

approved

a

multi-year

global

transformation

initiative

to

drive

increased

productivity

by

enhancing

end-to-end 

business

processes,

enabled

by

targeted

organizational

actions.

We

expect

to

incur

approximately

$

130

million

of

transformation 

charges related

to these actions, of

which approximately $

120

million will be

cash. These charges

are expected to

consist primarily of 

severance and other benefit costs, as well

as other charges, including

consulting and professional fees. We

recognized $

68.7

million of 

severance and

other benefit costs

and $

1.4

million of other

costs in 

fiscal 2025

related to these

actions. We

expect these

actions to be 

completed by the end of fiscal 2028. 

In fiscal

2025, we

increased the

estimate of

restructuring charges

that we

expect to

incur related

to our previously

announced actions 

in the International segment to optimize

our Häagen-Dazs shops network. As a result,

we expect to incur approximately $

24

million of 

incremental

restructuring

charges

related

to

these

actions,

of

which,

approximately

$

12

million

will

be

These

incremental 

charges are expected

to consist of approximately

$

9

We

expect to

incur total

restructuring charges

of approximately

$

which approximately

$

18

cash related 

to these actions.

We expect these actions to

be completed by the end of fiscal 2026.

Certain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations,

where required.

We

recorded

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 

As a

part of

our ongoing

operations, we

are exposed

to market

risks such

as changes

in interest

and foreign

currency exchange

rates 

and commodity and

equity prices. To

manage these risks, we

may enter into various

derivative transactions (e.g.,

futures, options, and 

swaps) pursuant to our established policies. 

COMMODITY PRICE RISK 

Many commodities we

use in the

production and distribution

of our products

are exposed to

market price risks.

We

utilize derivatives 

to manage price risk for our principal

ingredients and energy costs, including

grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils

(principally soybean), 

dairy products, natural

gas, and diesel fuel.

Our primary objective

when entering into

these derivative contracts

is to achieve

certainty 

with

regard

to

the

future

price

of

commodities

purchased

for

use

in

our

supply

chain.

We

manage

our

exposures

through

a 

combination of purchase orders, long-term

contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded

futures and options, and over-the-counter

options 

and swaps.

We

offset

our exposures

based on

current and

projected market

conditions and

generally seek

to acquire

the inputs

at as 

close as possible to or below our planned cost. 

We

use derivatives

to manage

our exposure

to changes

in commodity

prices. We

do not

perform the

assessments required

to achieve 

hedge accounting for

commodity derivative positions.

Accordingly,

the changes in

the values of

these derivatives are

recorded in

cost 

of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Although we do

not meet the

criteria for

cash flow hedge

accounting, we believe

that these instruments

are effective

in achieving our 

objective of providing certainty

in the future price of commodities purchased

for use in our supply chain.

Accordingly, for

purposes of 

measuring

segment

operating

performance

these

gains

and

losses

are

reported

in

unallocated

corporate

items

outside

of

segment 

operating results

until such time

that the exposure

we are managing

affects earnings.

At that time,

we reclassify

the gain or

loss from 

unallocated

corporate

items

to

segment

operating

profit,

allowing

our

operating

segments

to

realize

the

economic

effects

of

the 

derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility,

which remains in unallocated corporate items.

59 

Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 included:

As

May

the

net

notional

value

of

commodity

derivatives

was

$

227.1

million,

of

which

$

134.6

million

related

to 

agricultural inputs and

$

92.5

million related to

energy inputs. These

contracts relate to

inputs that generally

will be utilized

within the 

next 

12

months.

INTEREST RATE RISK 

We

are

exposed

to

interest

rate

volatility

with

regard

to

future

issuances

of

fixed-rate

debt,

and

existing

and

future

issuances

of 

floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury

rates, SOFR, Euribor, and

commercial paper rates in the United States and 

Europe.

We

use

interest

rate

swaps,

forward-starting

interest

rate

swaps,

and

treasury

locks

to

hedge

our

exposure

to

interest

rate 

changes,

to

reduce

the

volatility

of

our

financing

costs,

and

to

achieve

a

desired

proportion

of

fixed-rate

versus

floating-rate

debt, 

based

on

current

and

projected

market

conditions.

Generally

under

these

swaps,

we

agree

with

a

counterparty

to

exchange

the 

difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate

interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount. 

Floating Interest

Rate Exposures

— Floating-to-fixed

interest rate

swaps are

accounted for

as cash

flow hedges,

as are

all hedges

of 

forecasted

issuances

of

debt.

Effectiveness

is

assessed

based

on

either

the

perfectly

effective

hypothetical

derivative

method

or 

changes in the

present value of

interest payments on

the underlying debt.

Effective gains

During

interest rate

swap to

convert

our

€

, to a floating rate. 

During the

second quarter of

fiscal 2025, in

advance of planned

debt financing,

we entered into

$

350.0

million of treasury

locks. The 

treasury locks were terminated during the second quarter of fiscal

2025, in conjunction with the Company’s

issuance of $

of

fixed-rate

due 

January 30, 2035

Upon

termination,

a

our $

November 18, 2025

to a floating

by the counterparty

prior to the

maturity date. The

previously existing 

swap was designated

as a fair value

with the swap

being called, we

ceased recording market

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 

Foreign currency

fluctuations affect

our net

investments in

foreign subsidiaries

and foreign

currency cash

flows related

to third

party 

purchases,

intercompany

loans, product

shipments, and

foreign-denominated

debt.

We

are also

exposed

to the

translation of

foreign 

currency

earnings

to

the

U.S.

dollar.

Our

principal

exposures

are

to

the

Australian

dollar,

Brazilian

real,

British

pound

sterling, 

Canadian

dollar,

Chinese renminbi,

euro, Japanese

yen, Mexican

peso, and

Swiss franc.

We

primarily

use foreign

currency forward 

contracts to selectively hedge our

foreign currency cash flow exposures.

We also

generally swap our foreign-denominated

commercial 

paper

borrowings

and

nonfunctional

currency

intercompany

loans

back

to U.S.

dollars

or

the

functional

currency

of the

entity

with 

foreign exchange exposure.

The gains or losses

on these derivatives offset

the foreign currency

revaluation gains or losses

recorded in 

earnings on the associated borrowings. We

generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance. 

As of May 25, 2025, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives

was $

831.3

million.

We

also have

net investments

in foreign

subsidiaries that

are denominated

in euros.

We

hedged a portion

of these net

investments by 

issuing

euro-denominated

commercial

paper

and

foreign

exchange

forward

contracts.

As of

May

25,

2025,

we

hedged

a

portion

of 

these net

investments

with €

4,742.8

million of

euro denominated

bonds. As

of May

25, 2025,

we had

deferred

net foreign

currency 

transaction losses of $

123.5

million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity. 

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS 

Equity

price

movements

affect

our

compensation

expense

as

certain

made

by

use equity swaps

to manage this

risk. As of

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED

CONTINGENT FEATURES 

Certain of our

derivative instruments contain

provisions that require

us to maintain an

investment grade credit rating

on our debt

from 

each

of

the

major

credit

rating

agencies.

If

our

debt

were

to

fall

below

investment

grade,

the

counterparties

instruments

could

request

full

collateralization

on

positions.

The

aggregate

fair

of

all 

derivative instruments with credit-risk-related

contingent features that were in

a liability position on May

25, 2025, was $

24.8

We have

posted no collateral under

these contracts. If the credit-risk-related

contingent features underlying these

agreements had been 

triggered on May 25, 2025, we would have been required to post $

24.8

The $

million pre-tax loss recorded in AOCI as of May 25, 2025 associated

with our previously designated interest rate swaps will

NOTE 10. NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 

Our principal noncontrolling

interest related to our General

Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC)

subsidiary. The

third-party holder of the GMC 

Class 

A 

limited

membership

interests (GMC

Class

A

Interests)

received

quarterly

preferred

distributions

from

available

net

income 

based on the

application of a floating

preferred return rate

to the holder’s

capital account balance

established in the

most recent mark-

to-market valuation.

On June 1,

2024, the floating

preferred return

rate was reset

to the sum

of the 

three-month Term SOFR

plus 

261

basis points. 

During the

fourth quarter

of fiscal 2025,

we purchased

the outstanding

GMC Class A

Interests from

the third-party

holder for

$

252.8

million. The purchase

price reflected the

GMC Class A Interests’

original capital account balance

of $

242.3

million and $

10.5

million 

primarily

related

to

capital

account

appreciation

attributable

and

paid

to

the

third-party

holder

of

the

Class

A

Interests.

The

capital 

appreciation paid to the third-party holder of the Class A Interests was recorded

as a direct reduction to retained earnings, a component 

of stockholders’

equity,

on the Consolidated

Balance Sheets, and

reduced net earnings

available to common

stockholders in our

basic 

and diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations. 

For

financial

reporting

purposes,

the

assets,

liabilities,

results

of

operations,

and

cash

flows

of

our

non-wholly

owned

consolidated 

subsidiaries

are

included

in

our

Consolidated

Financial

Statements.

The

third-party

investor’s

share

of

the

net

earnings

of

these 

subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling

interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

NOTE 11. STOCKHOLDERS’

EQUITY 

Cumulative preference stock of 

5.0

million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued. 

On June 27, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the

repurchase of up to 

100

million shares of our common stock. Purchases under 

the authorization

can be

made in

the open

market or

negotiated

transactions, including

the use

NOTE 12. STOCK PLANS 

We

use broad-based stock

plans to help

ensure that management’s

interests are aligned

with those of

our shareholders. As

of May 25, 

2025,

a total

of 

29.5

million shares

were available

for grant

in the

form of

stock options,

restricted

stock, restricted

stock units,

and 

shares

of unrestricted

stock under

the 2022

Stock Compensation

Plan

(2022

Plan). The

2022

Plan

also provides

for

the issuance

of 

cash-settled

share-based

units, stock

appreciation

rights, and

performance-based

stock awards.

Stock-based

awards now

outstanding 

include

some

granted

under

the

2017

Stock

Compensation

Plan,

under

which

no

further

awards

may

be

granted.

The

stock

plans 

provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement,

termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.

We

estimate the

fair value

of each

option on

the grant

date using

a Black-Scholes

option-pricing

model, which

requires us

to make 

predictive assumptions

regarding future

stock price volatility,

employee exercise

behavior, dividend

yield, and

the forfeiture

rate. We 

estimate our future

stock price volatility

using the historical

volatility over

the expected term

of the option,

excluding time

periods of 

volatility we believe a marketplace participant would

exclude in estimating our stock price volatility.

We also have

considered, but did 

not use, implied

volatility in our estimate,

because trading activity in

options on our stock,

especially those with

tenors of greater than 

6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. 

Our

expected

term

represents

the

period

of

time

that

options

granted

are

expected

to

be

outstanding

based

on

historical

data

to 

estimate option exercises and employee

terminations within the valuation

model. Separate groups of employees

have similar historical 

exercise behavior and therefore

were aggregated into a

single pool for valuation

purposes. The weighted-average expected

term for all 

employee groups is presented in the table

above. The risk-free interest rate for

periods during the expected term of

the options is based 

on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in

effect at the time of grant. 

Any corporate

income tax

benefit realized

upon exercise

or vesting

of an

award in

excess of

that previously

recognized in

earnings 

(referred to

as a

windfall tax

benefit) is

presented in

our Consolidated

Statements of

Cash Flows

as an

flow.

Realized 

windfall

tax

benefits

and

shortfall

tax

deficiencies

related

to

the

exercise

or

Under the 2022 Plan,

options may be priced

at 

100

percent or more of the

fair market value on the

date of grant, generally issued

with 

four-year

graded vesting or 

four-year

cliff vesting. Options

generally expire within 

10 years and one month

after the date of

grant. As

NOTE 14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have

defined benefit pension plans covering

many employees in the United States,

Canada, Switzerland, and the United

Kingdom. 

Benefits for salaried

employees are based

on length of service

and final average

compensation. Benefits for

hourly employees include 

various monthly

amounts for each

year of credited

service. Our funding

policy is consistent

with the requirements

of applicable laws. 

We made 

no

voluntary contributions to our

principal U.S. plans in fiscal

2025 or fiscal 2024.

We do 

no

t expect to be required

to make 

any

contributions

to

our

principal

U.S.

plans

in

fiscal

2026.

Our

principal

U.S.

retirement

plan

covering

salaried

employees

has

a 

provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants

if the plan is terminated within 

five years

of a change 

in control.

All salaried employees

hired on

or after June 1,

2013, are

eligible for

a retirement program

that does not

include a defined 

benefit pension plan.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We

also

sponsor

plans

that

provide

health

care

benefits

to

many

of our

retirees

in

the United

States,

Canada,

and

Brazil.

The

U.S. 

salaried

health

care

benefit

plan

is

contributory,

with

retiree

contributions

based

on

years

of

service.

We

make

decisions

to

fund 

related trusts

for certain

employees and

retirees on an

annual basis.

We

made 

no

voluntary contributions

to these

plans in fiscal

2025 

or fiscal 2024. We

do 

no

t expect to be required to make any contributions to these plans in fiscal 2026.

Year

that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate

2034

2033

73 

We

review our

health care

cost trend

rates annually.

Our review

is based

on data

we collect

about our

health care

claims experience 

and information

provided by our

actuaries. This information

includes recent

plan experience,

plan design, overall

industry experience 

and projections, and

assumptions used by other

similar organizations.

Our initial health

care cost trend

rate is adjusted

as necessary to 

remain consistent

with this

review,

recent experiences,

and short-term

expectations. Our

initial health

care cost

trend rate

assumption 

is 

7.9

percent for retirees age

65 and over and for

retirees under age 65 at

the end of fiscal 2025.

Rates are graded down annually

until 

the

ultimate

trend

rate

of 

4.5

percent

is

reached

in 

2034

for

all

retirees.

The

trend

rates

are

applicable

for

calculations

only

if

the 

retirees’ benefits increase

as a result of

health care inflation. The

ultimate trend rate is

adjusted annually,

as necessary,

to approximate 

the current

economic

view on

the rate

of long-term

inflation plus

an appropriate

health

care cost

premium.

Assumed trend

rates for 

health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported

for the other postretirement benefit plans. 

Postemployment Benefit Plans

Under certain

circumstances, we

also provide

accruable benefits,

primarily severance,

to former

or inactive

employees in

the United 

States,

Canada,

and

Mexico.

We

recognize

an

obligation

for

any

of

these

benefits

that

vest

or

accumulate

with

service. 

Postemployment benefits

that do not

vest or

accumulate with

service (such

as severance

based solely

on annual pay

rather than

years 

of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment

benefit plans are unfunded.

During fiscal

2025, the

decrease in

defined benefit

pension obligations

was primarily

driven by

actuarial gains

due to

an increase

in 

the discount

rate, and

the decrease

in other

postretirement obligations

was primarily

driven by

due to plan

experience. 

During fiscal 2024,

the decreases in defined

benefit pension obligations

and other postretirement

obligations were primarily

driven by 

actuarial gains due to an increase in the discount rate. 

As of May 25, 2025,

other postretirement benefit plans

had benefit obligations of

Discount Rates 

We 

estimate

the

service

and

interest

cost

components

of

the

net

periodic

benefit

expense

for

our

United

States

and

most

of

our 

international

defined

benefit

pension,

other

postretirement

benefit,

and

postemployment

benefit

plans

utilizing

a

full

yield

curve 

approach

by applying

the specific

spot rates

along

the yield

curve used

to determine

the benefit

obligation

to the

relevant projected 

cash flows. Our

discount rate assumptions

are determined annually

as of May 31

for our defined

benefit pension, other

postretirement 

benefit, and

postemployment benefit

plan obligations.

We

also use

discount rates

as of

May 31 to

determine defined

benefit pension, 

other

postretirement benefit,

and

postemployment

benefit plan

income and

expense for

the following

fiscal year.

We

work with

our 

outside actuaries

to determine

the timing

and amount

of expected

future cash

outflows to

plan participants

and, using

the Aa

Above 

Median corporate

bond yield,

to develop

a forward

interest rate

curve, including

a margin

to that

index based on

our credit

risk. This 

forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows

to determine our discount rate assumptions.

There were 

no

transfers into or out of level 3 investments in fiscal 2025. During fiscal

2024, the initial public offering of certain equity

resulted

in

the

transfer

of

$

There 

were 

no

transfers into level 3 investments in fiscal 2024. 

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

Our expected

rate of return

on plan assets

is determined

by our asset

allocation, our

historical long-term

investment performance,

our 

estimate of future long-term returns

by asset class (using input from our

actuaries, investment services, and investment

managers), and 

long-term inflation

assumptions. We

review this assumption

annually for

each plan; however,

our annual

investment performance

for 

one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.

The investment

objective for

our defined

benefit pension

and other

postretirement benefit

plans is

to secure

the benefit

obligations to 

participants

at

a

reasonable

cost

to

us.

Our

goal

is

to

optimize

the

long-term

return

on

plan

assets

at

a

moderate

level

of

risk.

The 

defined benefit

pension plan

and other postretirement

benefit plan

portfolios are

broadly diversified

across asset

classes. Within

asset 

classes,

the

portfolios

are

further

diversified

across

investment

styles

and

investment

organizations.

For

the

U.S.

defined

benefit 

pension

plans,

the

long-term

investment

policy

allocation

is: 

8

percent

to

equities

in

the

United

States; 

5

percent

to

international 

equities; 

7

percent to private

equities; 

71

percent to fixed

income; and 

9

percent to real

assets (real estate,

energy,

and infrastructure). 

For other U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment

policy allocations are: 

26

percent to equities in the United States; 

13

percent to international

equities; 

7

percent to total

private equities; and 

54

percent to fixed

income.

The actual allocations

to these 

asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based

on relative market valuations. 

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments 

We

do 

no

t

expect

to

be

required

to

make

contributions

to

our

defined

benefit

pension,

other

postretirement

benefit,

and 

postemployment benefit

plans in

fiscal 2026.

Actual fiscal

2026 contributions

could exceed

our current

projections, as

influenced by 

our decision

to undertake

discretionary funding

of our benefit

trusts and

future changes

in regulatory

requirements. Estimated

benefit 

payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are

expected to be paid from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2035 as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

The

General

Mills

Savings

Plan

is

a

defined

contribution

plan

that

covers

domestic

salaried,

hourly,

nonunion,

and

certain

union 

employees.

This plan

is a

401(k)

savings plan

that includes

a number

of investment

funds, including

a Company

stock fund

and an 

Employee Stock

Ownership Plan

(ESOP). We

sponsor another

money purchase

plan for

certain domestic

hourly employees

with net 

assets of $

19.7

million as of May 25, 2025, and $

19.5

million as of May 26, 2024. We

also sponsor defined contribution plans in many 

of

our

foreign

locations.

Our

total

recognized

expense

related

to

defined

contribution

plans

was

$

96.1

million

in

fiscal

2025, 

$

94.0

million in fiscal 2024, and $

97.2

million in fiscal 2023. 

We

match a

percentage of

employee contributions

to the

General Mills

Savings Plan.

The Company

match is

directed to

investment 

options

of

the

participant’s

choosing.

The

number

of

shares

of

our

common

stock

allocated

to

participants

in

the

ESOP

was 

3.2

million as

of May

25, 2025,

and 

3.5

million as

of May

26, 2024.

The ESOP’s

only assets

are our

common stock

and temporary

cash 

balances. 

The Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held

$

292.7

million and $

393.0

million of Company common stock as of May 25, 

2025, and May 26, 2024, respectively.

The United States Congress

is currently drafting new

tax legislation referred to

as the One Big Beautiful

Bill Act. We

will continue to 

monitor developments as the legislation progresses and evaluate any

potential impacts on our financial statements. 

In

December

2021,

the

Organization

for

Economic

Cooperation

and

Development

(OECD)

established

a

framework,

referred

to

as 

Pillar

2,

designed

to

ensure

large

multinational

enterprises

pay

a

minimum

15

percent

level

of

tax

on

the

income

arising

in

each 

jurisdiction

in

which

they

operate.

Numerous

countries

have

already

enacted

the

OECD

model

rules

effective

for

taxable

years 

beginning

after

December

31,

2023,

which

for

us

was

fiscal

2025.

There

was

no

material

impact

on

our

consolidated

financial 

statements.

Several

other

countries

have

enacted

or

drafted

legislation

that

is

not

yet

effective

for

us,

and

we

do

not

expect

this 

legislation

to

have

a

material

impact

on

our

consolidated

financial

statements.

We

will

continue

to monitor

for

new

legislation

and 

guidance and evaluate any potential impact on our consolidated financial

statements. 

On August

16, 2022,

the Inflation

Reduction Act

(IRA) was

signed into

law.

The IRA

introduces

a Corporate

Alternative Minimum 

Tax beginning

in our fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock starting after

January 1, 2023. The IRA did not 

have a material impact on our financial results, including our annual

effective tax rates and liquidity. 

As of

May 25,

2025, we

have 

no

t recognized

a deferred

tax liability

for unremitted

earnings of

approximately $

2.3

billion from

our 

foreign operations

because we

currently believe

our subsidiaries

have invested

the undistributed

earnings indefinitely

or the

earnings 

will be remitted

in a tax-neutral

transaction. It

is not practicable

for us to

determine the amount

of unrecognized

tax expense on

these 

reinvested earnings.

Deferred taxes

are recorded

for earnings

of our

foreign operations

when we

determine that

such earnings

are no 

longer indefinitely reinvested. All

earnings prior to fiscal 2018

remain permanently reinvested. Earnings

from fiscal 2018 and later

are 

not permanently reinvested and local country withholding taxes are

recorded on earnings each year.

We are

subject to federal income

taxes in the United States

as well as various state, local,

and foreign jurisdictions. A

number of years 

may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.

While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the 

timing

of

resolution

of

any

particular

uncertain

tax

position,

we

believe

that

our

liabilities

for

income

taxes

reflect

the

most

likely 

outcome.

We

adjust

these

liabilities,

as

well

as

the

related

interest,

in

light

of

changing

facts

and

circumstances.

Settlement

of

any 

particular position would usually require the use of cash.

The number

of years

with open

tax audits

varies depending

on the

tax jurisdiction.

Our major

taxing jurisdiction

is the

United States 

(federal and state). Various

tax examinations by United States state taxing

authorities could be conducted for any

open tax year,

which 

vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 

3

to 

5

years.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently auditing

our federal tax returns for fiscal 2018 through 2022.

Several state and foreign 

examinations are currently in

progress. We

do not expect these examinations

to result in a material

impact on our results

of operations 

or financial position. During fiscal 2024,

we received a notice of proposed adjustment

from the IRS associated with a

capital loss from 

fiscal 2019.

We

believe that we

have meritorious defense

against this assessment

and will vigorously

defend our position.

We

do not 

expect the

resolution of

the proposed

adjustment to

have a material

impact on

our financial

position or

liquidity.

We

have effectively 

settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior. 

The Brazilian

tax authority,

Secretaria da

Receita Federal

do Brasil (RFB),

has concluded

audits of

our 2012

through 2020

tax return 

years. These

audits included

a review

of our

determinations of

amortization of

certain goodwill

arising from

the acquisition

of Yoki 

Alimentos

S.A.

The

RFB

has

proposed

adjustments

that

effectively

eliminate

the

goodwill

amortization

benefits

related

to

this 

transaction. We

believe we have meritorious defenses

and intend to continue to contest

the disallowance for all years.

Tax return

years 

2012 through 2013 have been resolved with no adjustments. 

We

apply a more-likely-than-not

threshold to the

recognition and derecognition

of uncertain tax

positions. Accordingly,

we recognize 

the amount of

tax benefit that

has a greater

than 50 percent

likelihood of being

ultimately realized upon

settlement. Future changes

in 

judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions

will affect earnings in the period of such change.

81 

The following table sets forth

changes in our total gross

unrecognized tax benefit liabilities,

excluding accrued interest,

for fiscal 2025 

and

fiscal 2024.

Approximately

$

98.2

million of

this total

in fiscal

2025

represents the

amount that,

if recognized,

would affect

our 

effective income tax rate in future periods.

This amount differs from the gross unrecognized

tax benefits presented in the table because 

certain

portions of

the liabilities

below

would

impact deferred

taxes if

recognized. 

We 

also would

record

a decrease

in U.S.

federal 

income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

guarantees

with

various

terms

of

$

163.5

million

for

the

debt

and

other

obligations

of

non-

consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW.

This amount represents the

maximum potential obligation that

we could be required to pay

under 

the guarantees.

We

have determined

the likelihood

of any

significant

amounts being

paid under

these guarantees

to be

remote.

Off-

baking mixes,

and bakery

flour.

Many products we

sell are branded

to the consumer 

and nearly

all are

branded to

our customers. 

We 

sell to

distributors and

operators in

many customer

channels including

foodservice, 

vending, and supermarket bakeries. 

Our CODM

is the

Chairman of

the Board

and Chief

Executive Officer.

The CODM

predominantly uses

segment operating

profit in 

the

annual

planning

process

which

includes

segment

operating

profit

performance

targets.

The

CODM

assesses

progress

against 

performance targets

by comparing

segment operating

profit actual-to-plan variances

on a monthly

basis. The performance

assessment 

completed by the

CODM is used to

determine whether resource

allocations require adjustment

and contributes to

the determination of 

incentive compensation. 

Operating

profit

for

these

segments

excludes

unallocated

corporate

items,

gain

or

loss

on

divestitures,

and

restructuring, 

transformation,

impairment,

and

other

exit

costs.

Results

from

certain

businesses

managed

by

our

Strategic

Growth

Office

are 

included within corporate and other net

sales and unallocated corporate items

within operating profit. Unallocated

corporate items also 

include

corporate

overhead

expenses,

variances

to

planned

North

American

employee

benefits

and

incentives,

certain

charitable 

contributions, restructuring

initiative project-related

costs, gains and

losses on corporate

investments, and

other items that

are not part 

of our

measurement

of segment

operating

performance.

These include

gains and

losses arising

from the

revaluation of

certain

grain 

inventories

and

gains

and

losses

from

mark-to-market

valuation

of

certain

commodity

positions

until

passed

back

to

our

operating 

segments.

These items

affecting

operating profit

are centrally

managed

at the

corporate level

and

are excluded

from the

measure

of 

segment

profitability

reviewed by

executive

management.

Under

our

supply chain

organization,

our

manufacturing,

warehouse,

and 

distribution activities

are substantially

integrated across

our operations

in order

to maximize

efficiency

and productivity.

As a

result, 

fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained

nor available by operating segment.

Fair value

hierarchy.

For purposes

of fair

value measurement,

we categorize

assets and

liabilities into

one of

three levels

based on 

the assumptions

(inputs) used

in valuing

the asset or

liability.

Level 1 provides

the most reliable

measure of

fair value, while

Level 3 

generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels

are defined as follows: 

Level 1:

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2:

Observable inputs other

than quoted prices included

in Level 1, such

as quoted prices for

similar assets or liabilities

in 

active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets

. 

Level 3:

Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s

assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability. 

Free cash flow.

Net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of land, buildings, and equipment

. 

Free

cash

Hedge accounting.

Accounting for qualifying

hedges that allows changes in

a hedging instrument’s

fair value to offset

corresponding 

changes in

the hedged

item in

the same

reporting period

.

Hedge accounting

is permitted

for certain

hedging instruments

and hedged 

items

only

if

the

hedging

is

highly

effective,

and

only

prospectively

from

the

of

the design

operation

of

our

disclosure

controls

and

procedures

(as

defined

Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded

that,

controls and procedures

were effective

to ensure that information

required to be disclosed

by us in 

reports

that

we

file

or

under

the

1934

Act

is

(1)

recorded,

processed,

summarized,

and

reported

within

the

time

periods 

specified

in applicable

rules and

forms, and

(2)

accumulated and

communicated

to our

management,

including our

Chief Executive 

Officer and Chief Financial Officer,

in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

90 

There were

no changes

in our

internal control

over financial

reporting (as

defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the

1934 Act)

during our 

fiscal quarter ended May

25, 2025, that have materially

affected, or are reasonably

likely to materially affect,

our internal control

over 

financial reporting. 

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The

management

of

General

is

responsible

for

establishing

and

maintaining

adequate

internal

control

over

financial 

reporting,

as

such

term

is

defined

in

Rule

13a-15(f)

under

the

1934

Act.

The

provide

reasonable

assurance

to

our

management

and

the

Board

of

Directors

regarding

the

preparation

and

fair

of 

published

financial

Under

the

supervision

and

with

the

participation

of

management,

including

our

Chief

Executive 

Officer and Chief Financial Officer,

we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness

of our internal control over financial reporting

making this assessment, management

used the criteria set forth

by the Committee of Sponsoring

Organizations of 

the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

. 

Based

on

our

assessment

using

the

criteria

set

forth

by

COSO

in 

Internal

Control

–

Integrated

Framework

(2013)

,

management 

concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective

as of May 25, 2025. 

KPMG

LLP,

our

independent

registered
