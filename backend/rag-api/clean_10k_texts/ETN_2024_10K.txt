Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General

Raw Materials

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, lead, silver, gold, titanium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, chemicals, and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as coils, sheets, strips, ingots, bars, extrusions, castings, forgings, stampings, powder metal, plastic resins, and pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. To mitigate the impact of supply chain risk events we continue to invest in supply chain resiliency and work closely with our partners.

Intellectual Property

Eaton considers its intellectual property, including without limitation patents, trade names, domain names, trademarks, confidential information, and trade secrets to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products may be manufactured, marketed and sold using a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not in and of itself have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company works diligently to protect its intellectual property, including innovations, through various legal means.

Environmental Contingencies

Our comprehensive sustainability strategy is driven by our mission to improve the quality of life and the environment. We are committed to reducing our footprint, eliminating waste, and making the best use of natural resources. None-the-less, operations of the Company involve emissions, as well as the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures, including expenditures for environmental control facilities, earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Compliance with future environmental protection laws may require an increase in capital expenditures. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 11 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Eaton uses and monitors a variety of metrics to ensure our objectives related to employee attraction, development, and retention are met. Most notably, Eaton tracks the following:

Inclusion and Diversity

Eaton is committed to having a workforce that is diverse and inclusive at all levels. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the best employees without regard to race, color, social or economic status, religion, national origin, marital status, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any protected status. It is the policy of the Company to make all decisions regarding employment based on the principle of equal employment opportunity and without discrimination. 

At December 31, 2024, Eaton’s distribution by gender, and United States distribution by minority status, is as follows: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

1 Excluding Puerto Rico

At Eaton, one of our aspirations is to be a model of inclusion and diversity among our peers. Our plan to achieve this encompasses a number of actions, including an examination into our programs, practices, processes, and policies to look for opportunities to strengthen our workforce. 

Compensation

A key component of Eaton’s attraction and retention strategy is providing a competitive total rewards package which includes items such as salaries, wages, short- and long-term incentive compensation, in addition to health, welfare, retirement, and other benefits. Eaton regularly benchmarks its compensation and benefits practices against those of our industry peers and in the markets in which we operate to ensure our plans and programs are aligned with external practices in effort to maintain a high performing workforce. Eaton's 2024 total employee costs were $6.5 billion including salaries, wages, equity-based compensation, pension and other benefits. The total compensation of our median employee on October 1, 2023, as reported in our 2024 Proxy Statement filed on March 15, 2024, and as calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was $50,683. 

Safety

Throughout our operations, our goal is to have no safety incidents and we continue to make progress towards that goal. Our 2023 Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR) was 0.43 and our Days Away Case Rate (DACR) was 0.20. We have improved our TRCR 38% since 2018 and consider our 2030 target of 0.25 to be a world-leading safety rating. Our 2024 TRCR will be provided in our annual Sustainability Report to be issued in 2025.

Achieving work-life balance

Achieving work-life balance is a common concern of today's employees. Flexible work solutions and inclusive programs will help us remain competitive in attracting and retaining the best talent and make it possible for employees in varied situations to be able to remain at Eaton. Flexible solutions include compressed work weeks, remote working, job sharing, part-time work, flextime, and telework. 

Engagement

Fully engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and satisfied in their work. Examples of how we engage our employees include enterprise-wide town halls, hosting informal listening meetings and surveying groups of employees on specific subjects. In addition, we have programs focused on career development of employees at all levels and we are committed to a wide range of strategies designed to improve and sustain employee engagement over the long-term. Our most recent engagement survey of all employees was completed in 2023. Of those who responded to the survey, 84% had favorable engagement indicating they were proud to work at Eaton, felt personal accomplishment from their work, and would recommend Eaton as a place to work. We will perform another survey of all employees in 2025.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Among the risks that could materially adversely affect Eaton's businesses, financial condition or results of operations are the following:

Operational Risks

If Eaton is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyberbased attacks or network security breaches, product or service offerings could be compromised or operations could be disrupted or data confidentiality impaired.

Eaton relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. Some of this information may be stored in the cloud or on networks not managed by Eaton. Additionally, many of our products and services include, and we utilize and rely on third-party service-providers whose products include integrated software and information technology that collects data or connects to external and internal systems. Because of this, cybersecurity threats pose a material risk to our business operations.

Global cybersecurity threats range from widespread vulnerabilities, sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, or uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT/OT systems. These threats may be directed at Eaton, its products, software embedded in Eaton’s products, or its third-party service providers. The risk is amplified by the increasingly connected nature of our products and systems. These threats may originate from anywhere in the connected world and while they may take the form of phishing, malware, bots, or human-centric attacks, the nature of the threat is constantly evolving. Eaton continues to deploy reasonable comprehensive measures designed to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats. 

As a result of our worldwide operations, we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection/privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions. For example, the Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) prefers that we manage personal data in the E.U. and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations.

Eaton’s customers, including governmental agencies, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards which may result in additional operating or production costs. Our cybersecurity program aligns with well-known industry-wide security control frameworks. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include theft of intellectual property, disruption of operations, reputational damage, adverse health and safety consequences, the loss or misuse of confidential information, product failure, as well as exposure to fines, legal claims or enforcement actions.

The effects of climate change, including weather disruptions and regulatory/market reactions, create uncertainties that could negatively impact our business.

Global increases in greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change, and there is a growing consensus that dramatic emissions reductions are needed to avoid severe climate impacts. Extreme weather events linked to climate change, including hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and high heat/water scarcity, may create physical risks to Eaton’s operating locations and supply chains, as well as to Eaton's customers' operations. While Eaton is working to make its own operations carbon neutral by 2030, external factors could cause increases in these extreme weather events, political instability, and workforce migration, ultimately increasing Eaton’s cost of doing business. 

Regulatory reactions to climate change may pose more stringent obligations on Eaton’s operations and change customer demands. While Eaton is already gearing its portfolio towards products that will reduce carbon and combat climate change, there is a risk that Eaton may not innovate quickly enough to meet changing regulatory or market demands. Increasing demands for metals as the world electrifies may lead to scarcity and increased costs, as may uncertainty over carbon taxes and grid stability during a renewables transition. Despite these uncertainties, we believe Eaton is well positioned to capitalize on secular trends and market opportunities arising from these risks.

Eaton's operations depend on production facilities throughout the world, which subjects them to varying degrees of risk of disrupted production.

Eaton manages businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, geopolitical instability and/or conflict, political unrest, terrorist activity, economic upheaval, or public health concerns (for example, COVID-19). Any such disruption could cause delays in production and shipment of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate for losses.

Eaton uses a variety of raw materials, components and services in its businesses, and significant inflation could increase operating costs that may not be fully recouped in product pricing.

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials are described above in Item 1 Raw Materials. Global shortages have continued to affect the prices Eaton's businesses are charged for raw materials, particularly commodities. Further, Eaton has been impacted by logistics and wage inflation. If this trend continues and we are unable to address it with price increases, product modifications or other adjustments, our competitive position may be impacted, which could have a material adverse impact on operating results.

Further, some of our suppliers of component parts have increased their prices in response to increased costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture component parts. Should this trend continue or become more prevalent, it could adversely affect our operating results.

Significant shortages of raw materials, energy, components, and/or labor, or similar challenges for our customers could continue to adversely impact our results of operations.

Eaton has been affected by supply chain disruptions and unexpected shortages of raw materials in the future could impact our results. Further, labor shortages persist broadly in select markets. Some of our suppliers have experienced the same conditions and in response, have continued to increase their prices in response to increases in their costs of raw materials, energy and/or labor. While we strive to recoup these increased costs through our pricing or other mediating responses, if we are unable to do so without compromising the competitive position of our products and services, our results could continue to be impacted by this trend. Further, should these trends continue or worsen, the impact could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.

Industry and Market Risks

Volatility of end markets that Eaton serves. 

Eaton's segment revenues, operating results, and profitability have varied in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Profitability can be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions and volatility in the end markets that Eaton serves. We have undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of the markets we serve and expansion of the geographic regions in which we operate. Future downturns in any of the markets could adversely affect revenues, operating results, and profitability.

Technology disruption may impact our stock price and/or negatively impact our end markets.

Our products and services support cutting edge technology and mega trends, including, for example, data centers. These markets have experienced and may continue to experience the abrupt introduction of disruptive technologies, which may, in turn, negatively impact our end markets. Additionally, equity markets in this space may be volatile, and may not react rationally to newly introduced products, thus impacting our stock price.

Eaton's operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that Eaton will continue to successfully introduce new products and services or maintain its present market positions.

The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected, to varying degrees, by technological changes and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which could result in unpredictable product transitions or shortened life cycles. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, or marketing of new products and services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to bring new products and services to market. Our positions may also be impacted by new entrants into our product or regional markets.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Eaton's global operations subject it to economic risk as Eaton's results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government legislation, regulations and policies, or currency fluctuations.

Operating globally subjects Eaton to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including, but not limited to, those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, data privacy, and exchange controls. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could affect Eaton's operating results. While we monitor exchange rate exposures and attempt to reduce these exposures through hedging activities, these risks could adversely affect our operating results.

Changes in countries' trade policy globally, including imposition of sanctions or tariffs, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

Changes globally in various countries’ trade policies, including tariffs and duties, may materially increase costs for goods imported into the United States and could potentially lead to broader cost pressures even for goods that are not imported. If Eaton is unable to take mitigating actions, it could negatively impact product margins and our financial performance. Additionally, potential price increases or other mitigating efforts could negatively impact market share or otherwise increase the risk of customer disputes, giving rise to possible cash flow impacts. Furthermore, globally evolving trade policies may lead to abrupt or unpredictable changes in tariffs, quotas, duties or trade agreements, potential violations or litigation, which may disrupt our supply chain and/or lead to an increase in costs. Such policies could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries, therefore negatively impacting our financial performance.

Eaton may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates, changes in global tax laws and regulations, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.

Eaton is subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions around the world. Income tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be affected materially by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, or changes in tax legislation, regulations, and policies. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits and litigation by tax authorities in the countries in which we operate. If these audits and/or litigation result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include material unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.

Eaton may be unable to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.

Protecting our intellectual property rights is critical to our ability to compete and succeed. We own a large number of patents and patent applications worldwide, as well as trademark and copyright registrations that are necessary, and contribute significantly, to the preservation of our competitive position in various markets. Although management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial position of Eaton or its business segments, there can be no assurance that any one, or more, of these patents and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented by third parties. Eaton enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, and into non-disclosure agreements with suppliers and appropriate customers, so as to limit access to and disclosure of proprietary information. These measures may not suffice to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of similar technologies. 

Eaton is subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact Eaton's businesses.

At any given time, Eaton may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations. Information regarding current legal proceedings is presented in Note 11 and Note 12 of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity.

Risk Management and Strategy.

Eaton follows the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework to structure protocols for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. In accordance with NIST guidance, Eaton maintains documented information security policies and standards to protect operations, assets, data and services and to defend against, respond to and recover from potential cyberattacks. These policies and standards include both preventive measures and reactive processes. Preventive measures include, but are not limited to, protective and detective cybersecurity systems, security monitoring, threat hunting and mandatory, enterprise-wide employee training. Eaton’s reactive processes are captured primarily by a cyber incident response plan (the IRP), which is comprised of an evolving set of procedures developed by cross-functional experts, and external consultants, who draw upon technical proficiency and learnings from past experiences. All of these procedures and practices are tailored to Eaton’s technology environment and are refined iteratively. Further, Eaton has an information risk management program that includes a vendor risk assessment process, whereby Eaton systematically oversees and identifies risks from cybersecurity threats related to its use of third-party service providers.

The IRP is executed by an Incident Response Team (IRT), led by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The exact composition of the IRT varies depending on the severity and potential impact of an incident, and will typically include stakeholders across corporate and business functions. The team collaborates with internal experts and may engage external resources to assess and contain a threat if deemed necessary. Such external resources may potentially include forensic investigation and response firms, law firms, external auditors, forensic accountants, and consultants who are on retainer contracts for expedited availability.

While cybersecurity threats remain a risk to the Company’s business operations (see discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.), our robust risk mitigation strategies have been effective. Accordingly, no such threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company, our business strategy, results of operations or our financial condition.

Governance. 

Eaton's Board of Directors is trained annually regarding incident response and risk management. While our Board of Directors as a whole has oversight of risk management generally, cybersecurity risks fall to the Board’s Audit Committee. The Company’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CISO report quarterly to the Audit Committee on any significant cybersecurity incidents, threats, mitigation strategies and controls. The Audit Committee then updates the full board on significant matters raised and discussed during these sessions. The Audit Committee also participates in risk management training related to cybersecurity risk management specifically.

The Audit Committee delegates day-to-day management of cybersecurity risks to the Company’s senior management, which includes our CISO, who reports to the Company’s CIO. Our CIO reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Ordinary Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

The Company's ordinary shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ETN. At December 31, 2024, there were 9,117 holders of record of the Company's ordinary shares. Additionally, 13,949 current and former employees were shareholders through participation in the Eaton Savings Plan, the Eaton Personal Investment Plan, and The Eaton Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan.

Information regarding equity-based compensation plans required by Regulation S-K Item 201(d) is provided in Item 12 of this Form 10-K Report.

Irish Taxes Applicable to Dividends

Irish income tax may arise with respect to dividends paid on Eaton shares. Eaton may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (“IDWT”, currently at a rate of 25%) from dividends paid to shareholders who are not tax residents of Ireland even though they are not subject to this tax. To claim exemption from IDWT, shareholders can complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax exemption forms or hold their shares in an account through the Depository Trust Company and have on file with their broker or qualifying agent a valid U.S. address on the record date of the dividend.

Eaton shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability for Irish income tax on the dividends unless they are otherwise subject to Irish income tax.

Issuer’s Purchases of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2024, 2.5 million ordinary shares were repurchased in the open market at a total cost of $870 million. These shares were repurchased under the program approved by the Board on February 23, 2022 (the 2022 Program). A summary of the shares repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2024 is as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eaton Corporation plc

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Eaton Corporation plc (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

| Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits  

Description of the Matter|   
As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had gross unrecognized income tax benefits of $1,361 million related to its uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2024. Unrecognized income tax benefits are recorded under the two-step recognition and measurement principles when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard, or if a tax position meets the more likely than not standard, but the financial statement tax benefit is reduced as part of the measurement step.   
The balance of unrecognized income tax benefits is comprised of uncertain tax positions which meet the more likely than not standard, but the financial statement tax benefit has been reduced as part of measuring the tax position.  
Auditing management’s analysis of its uncertain tax positions and resulting unrecognized income tax benefits is complex as each tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated and ultimate resolution is dependent on uncontrollable factors such as the timing of finalizing resolutions of audit disputes through reaching settlement agreements or concluding litigation, or changes in law, and other factors.  
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit| We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls related to uncertain tax positions. For example, we tested controls over management’s application of the two-step recognition and measurement principles and management’s review of the inputs and resultant calculations of unrecognized income tax benefits, as well as the identification of new factors affecting existing uncertain tax positions.   
We also evaluated the Company’s assessment of its uncertain tax positions. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management’s accounting policies and documentation to assess the appropriateness and consistency of the methods and assumptions used to develop its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized income tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company. For example, we compared the unrecognized income tax benefits recorded with similar positions in prior periods and assessed management’s consideration of current tax controversy and litigation, including current year developments with respect to the Company's ongoing litigation and examinations with respect to certain open tax years in the United States. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates of its unrecognized income tax benefits with the resolution of those positions. In addition, we involved tax subject matter professionals to evaluate the application of relevant tax laws, regulations, case law, and Company-specific controversy developments in the Company’s recognition determination. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Eaton Corporation plc 

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited Eaton Corporation plc’s (“the Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Amounts are in millions unless indicated otherwise (per share data assume dilution). Columns and rows may not add and the sum of components may not equal total amounts reported due to rounding.

Note 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General Information and Basis of Presentation

Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) is an intelligent power management company dedicated to protecting the environment and improving the quality of life for people everywhere. We make products for the data center, utility, industrial, commercial, machine building, residential, aerospace and mobility markets. We are guided by our commitment to operate sustainably and with the highest ethical standards. Our work is accelerating the planet’s transition to renewable energy sources, helping to solve the world’s most urgent power management challenges, and building a more sustainable society for people today and for future generations.

Founded in 1911, Eaton has continuously evolved to meet the changing and expanding needs of our stakeholders. With revenues of nearly $25 billion in 2024, the Company serves customers in more than 160 countries.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eaton and all subsidiaries and other entities it controls. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associate companies where the Company has significant influence and generally a 20% to 50% ownership interest. Equity investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the book value of the investment exceeds fair value. An impairment would exist if there is an other-than-temporary decline in value. Investments in associate companies included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $872 million and $860 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income (loss) from these investments was $12 million, $20 million, and $(5) million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and reported in Other income - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Eaton does not have off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities.

Eaton's reporting currency is United States Dollars (USD). The functional currency for most subsidiaries is their local currency. Financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date as to assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates as to revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, non-monetary assets and liabilities such as inventory and property, plant and equipment and their related expenses are remeasured at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are recognized in income. Gains from the remeasurement of foreign currency were $15 million, $27 million, and $67 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, net of the impact of currency exchange contracts.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

Eaton adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, in the fourth quarter of 2024 on a retrospective basis. This accounting standard requires additional segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, including significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The standard does not change how operating segments and reportable segments are determined. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and is based on the net assets for each reporting unit, including goodwill and intangible assets. The Company’s reporting units are equivalent to the reportable operating segments, except for the Aerospace segment which has two reporting units. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis.

The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a quantitative analysis in 2024, except for the Vehicle and eMobility reporting units which used a qualitative analysis in 2024. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a qualitative analysis in 2023, except for the Vehicle reporting unit which used a quantitative analysis in 2023. A qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative analysis performed for each reporting unit. The results of the qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform quantitative analysis. 

Quantitative analyses were performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. The model includes estimates of future cash flows, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The future cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the reporting unit's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. 

Based on these analyses performed in 2024 and 2023, the fair value of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts and thus, no impairment exists.

Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for 2024 and 2023 was performed using a quantitative analysis. The Company determines the fair value of these assets using a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows, and profitability. Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. For 2024 and 2023, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value.

For additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 6.

Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, Eaton uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The length of a lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. The Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease assets or liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Additionally, when accounting for leases, the Company combines payments for leased assets, related services and other components of a lease.

Other Long-Lived Assets

Depreciation and amortization for property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, are generally computed by the straight-line method and included in Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, and Research and development expense, as appropriate. The Company uses the following depreciation and amortization periods:| | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Category| | Estimated useful life or amortization period  
Buildings| | Generally 40 years  
Machinery and equipment| | 3 \- 10 years  
Software| | 5 \- 15 years  
Customer relationships, certain trademarks, and patents and technology| | Weighted-average of 18 years  

Other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Upon indications of impairment, assets and liabilities are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The asset group would be considered impaired when the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are less than its carrying value. Determining asset groups and underlying cash flows requires the use of significant judgment.

Retirement Benefits Plans

For the principal pension plans in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom, the Company uses a market-related value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit costs. The market-related value of plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period. All other plans use fair value of plan assets.

Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. The Company’s corridors are set at either 8% or 10%, depending on the plan, of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If most or all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used. The amortization periods on a weighted average basis for United States and Non-United States pension plans are approximately 21 years and 10 years, respectively. The amortization period for other postretirement benefits plans is 8 years.

Asset Retirement Obligations

A conditional asset retirement obligation is recognized at fair value when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation would be considered in the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. Eaton believes that for substantially all of its asset retirement obligations, there is an indeterminate settlement date because the range of time over which the Company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated. A liability for these obligations will be recognized when sufficient information is available to estimate fair value.

Income Taxes

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of the respective assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards. Judgment is required in determining and evaluating income tax provisions and valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets. Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Eaton evaluates and adjusts these accruals based on changing facts and circumstances. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense. Eaton's policy is to recognize income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income when individual units of account are sold, terminated, or extinguished. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 12.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Eaton uses derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure to the volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt. These instruments are marked to fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether an instrument has been designated as a hedge. For those instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, Eaton designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in fair value of these instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in net income. See Note 16 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). This accounting standard requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on an annual basis, including information on the Company’s effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 and expects the standard will only impact its income taxes disclosures with no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASU 2024-03). This accounting standard requires disaggregated income statement expense disclosures on an annual and interim basis, including inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization for each income statement line item that contains these expenses. The standard also requires disclosure of total selling expenses on an annual and interim basis, and the definition of those expenses disclosed annually. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 and expects the standard will only impact its disclosures with no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Note 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES

Sale of Hydraulics business

On August 2, 2021, Eaton completed the sale of the Hydraulics business to Danfoss A/S. As a result of the sale, the Company received $3.1 billion, net of cash sold, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $617 million in 2021. The Company finalized negotiations of post-closing adjustments with Danfoss A/S during the first quarter of 2022 and recognized an additional pre-tax gain of $24 million and received cash of $22 million from Danfoss A/S to fully settle all post-closing adjustments. 

Acquisition of Royal Power Solutions

On January 5, 2022, Eaton acquired Royal Power Solutions for $610 million, net of cash received. Royal Power Solutions is a U.S. based manufacturer of high-precision electrical connectivity components used in electric vehicle, energy management, industrial and mobility markets. Royal Power Solutions is reported within the eMobility business segment.

The acquisition of Royal Power Solutions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. The final allocation as of the date of acquisition follows:

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the anticipated synergies of acquiring Royal Power Solutions. Goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The estimated fair values of the customer relationships, technology, trademarks, and other intangible assets of $230 million, $90 million, $16 million, and $5 million, respectively, were determined using either the relief-from-royalty model, the multi-period excess earnings model, or the lost income model, which are discounted cash flow models that rely on the Company's estimates. These estimates require judgment of future revenue growth rates, future margins, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The estimated fair value of technology and trademark intangibles are also based on the selection of royalty rates used in the valuation model. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. The estimated useful lives for customer relationships, technology, trademarks, and other intangible assets were 17 years, 16 years, 15 years, and 2 years, respectively. See Note 6 for additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets.

Eaton's 2022 consolidated financial statements include Royal Power Solutions' results of operations, including segment operating profit of $21 million on sales of $158 million, from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022.

Note 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION

Sales are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to our customers. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. Sales are measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to be paid in exchange for these products or services. 

The majority of the Company’s sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when title and risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over time are less than 5% of Eaton’s consolidated Net sales. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions.

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed for obligations recognized over time, Eaton estimates total costs by contract. The estimate of total costs are subject to judgment. Estimated amounts are included in the recognized sales price to the extent it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative sales will occur. Additionally, contracts can be modified to account for changes in contract specifications, requirements or sale price. The effect of a contract modification on the sales price or adjustments to the measure of completion under the input method are recognized as adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.

Payment terms vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered. Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Eaton does not evaluate whether the selling price includes a financing interest component for contracts that are less than a year. Sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue are excluded from Net sales. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of products sold.

Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Accrued rebates of $361 million and $402 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are generally paid annually and are included in Other current liabilities. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Sales commissions are expensed when the amortization period is less than a year and are generally not capitalized as they are typically earned at the completion of the contract when the customer is invoiced or when the customer pays Eaton.

Sales of products and services varies by segment and are discussed in Note 19.

In the Electrical Americas segment, sales contracts are primarily for electrical components, industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, residential products, single phase power quality and connectivity, three phase power quality, wiring devices, circuit protection, utility power distribution, power reliability equipment, and services that are primarily produced and sold in North and South America. The majority of the sales in this segment contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility. However, certain power distribution and power quality services are recognized over time.

In the Electrical Global segment, sales contracts are primarily for electrical components, industrial components, power distribution and assemblies, single phase and three phase power quality, and services that are primarily produced and sold outside of North and South America, as well as hazardous duty electrical equipment, emergency lighting, fire detection, intrinsically safe explosion-proof instrumentation, and structural support systems that are produced and sold globally. The majority of the sales contracts in this segment contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility. However, certain power distribution and power quality services are recognized over time.

In the Aerospace segment, sales contracts are primarily for aerospace fuel, hydraulics, and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use, as well as filtration systems for industrial applications. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order, and frequently covered by terms and conditions included in a long-term agreement. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility. Our military contracts are primarily fixed-price contracts that are not subject to performance-based payments or progress payments from the customer.

Table of Contents

Many of the products and services in power distribution and power quality services in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments and contracts to develop new products that are fully funded by customers in the Aerospace business segment meet the definition of continuous transfer of control to customers and are recognized over time. These products are engineered to a customer’s design specifications, have no alternative use to Eaton, and are controlled by the customer as evidenced by the customer’s contractual ownership of the work in process or our right to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable margin. As control is transferring over time, sales are recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the obligation. Eaton generally uses an input method to determine the progress completed and sales are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.

In the Vehicle segment, sales contracts are primarily for drivetrains, powertrain systems and critical components that reduce emissions and improve fuel economy, stability, performance, and safety of cars, light trucks, and commercial vehicles. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order or a blanket purchase order subject to firm releases, frequently covered by terms and conditions included in a master supply agreement. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility.

In the eMobility segment, sales contracts are primarily for mechanical, electrical, and electronic components and systems that improve the power management and performance of both on-road and off-road vehicles. These sales contracts are primarily based on a customer’s purchase order. In this segment, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time either when we ship the product from our facility, or when it arrives at the customer’s facility.

In limited circumstances, primarily in the Electrical and Vehicle segments, Eaton sells separately-priced warranties that extend the warranty coverage beyond the standard coverage offered on specific products. Sales for these separately-priced warranties are recorded based on their stand-alone selling price and are recognized as revenue over the length of the warranty period.

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (revenue recognized exceeds amount billed to the customer), and deferred revenue (advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized). Accounts receivable from customers were $4,079 million and $3,966 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled receivables were $330 million and $289 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in unbilled receivables reflects higher revenue recognized and not yet billed from increased business activity in 2024.

Changes in the deferred revenue liabilities are as follows:| | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---

Deferred revenue liabilities of $602 million and $610 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the remaining balance presented in Other noncurrent liabilities.

A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to releases by customers. In measuring backlog of unsatisfied or partially satisfied obligations, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at December 31, 2024 was approximately $15.9 billion. At December 31, 2024, approximately 74% of this backlog is targeted for delivery to customers in the next twelve months and the rest thereafter.

Note 4. CREDIT LOSSES FOR RECEIVABLES

Receivables are exposed to credit risk based on the customers’ ability to pay which is influenced by, among other factors, their financial liquidity position. Eaton’s receivables are generally short-term in nature with a majority outstanding less than 90 days.

Eaton performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and maintains sufficient allowances for potential credit losses. The Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on the length of time the receivable is past due, and any anticipated future write-off based on historic experience adjusted for market conditions. The Company's segments, supported by our global credit department, perform the credit evaluation and monitoring process to estimate and manage credit risk. The process includes an evaluation of credit losses for both the overall segment receivable and specific customer balances. The process also includes review of customer financial information and credit ratings, approval and monitoring of customer credit limits, and an assessment of market conditions. The Company may also require prepayment from customers to mitigate credit risk. Receivable balances are written off against an allowance for credit losses after a final determination of collectability has been made. 

Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for credit losses of $55 million and $38 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses includes expense and net write-offs, none of which are significant.

Note 5. INVENTORY

Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost components include raw materials, purchased components, direct labor, indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and inspection costs.

The components of inventory are as follows:

Note 7. SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAM

The Company negotiates payment terms directly with its suppliers for the purchase of goods and services. In addition, a third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at the supplier’s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. If a supplier elects to participate in the SCF program, the supplier decides which invoices are sold to the financial institution and the Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell an invoice. Payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. The amounts due to the financial institution for suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

The changes in SCF obligations are as follows:

| | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Note 8. LEASES

Eaton leases certain manufacturing facilities, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, vehicles, and equipment. Most real estate leases contain renewal options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. The Company's lease agreements typically do not contain any significant guarantees of asset values at the end of a lease or restrictive covenants. Payments within certain lease agreements are adjusted periodically for changes in an index or rate.

The components of lease expense are as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

During 2020, the Company announced it was freezing its United States pension plans for its non-union employees. The freeze was effective January 1, 2021 for non-union U.S. employees whose retirement benefit was determined under a cash balance formula and is effective January 1, 2026 for non-union U.S. employees whose retirement benefit is determined under a final average pay formula.

Actuarial gains related to changes in the United States and Non-United States benefit obligations in 2024 of $20 million and $82 million, respectively, were primarily due to increases in the discount rates used to measure the obligations. Actuarial losses related to changes in the United States and Non-United States benefit obligations in 2023 of $104 million and $104 million, respectively, were primarily due to decreases in the discount rates used to measure the obligations.

Retirement Benefits Plans Assumptions

In 2024, 2023 and 2022, for purposes of determining liabilities related to the majority of its plans in the United States, the Company used the Pri-2012 mortality tables as well as mortality tables that are based on the Company's own experience and generational improvement scales that are based on MP-2021. 

To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the vast majority of its defined benefits pension and other postretirement benefits plans, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the relevant projected cash flows.

The expected long-term rate of return on pension assets was determined for each country and reflects long-term historical data taking into account each plan's target asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return on pension assets for United States pension plans and Non-United States pension plans for 2025 are 7.00% and 6.63%, respectively. The discount rates were determined using appropriate bond data for each country.

Pension Plan Assets

Investment policies and strategies are developed on a country and plan specific basis. The United States plan, representing 61% of worldwide pension assets, and the United Kingdom plans representing 25% of worldwide pension assets, are invested primarily in debt securities largely for liability hedging, as the majority of the assets are in plans that are well-funded. In general, the plans are primarily allocated to diversified high-quality publicly traded debt, primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled funds in the form of common collective and other trusts. The United States plan's target allocation is 15% United States equities, 7% non-United States equities, 3% public real estate (primarily equity of real estate investment trusts), 64% debt securities and 11% other, including private equity, private debt and cash equivalents. The United Kingdom plans' target asset allocations are 16% equities and the remainder in debt securities, cash equivalents and real estate investments. The equity risk for the plans is managed through broad diversification across industries, geographies, and levels of market capitalization. The majority of debt allocations for these plans are longer duration government and corporate debt. The United States, United Kingdom and Canada pension plans are authorized to use derivatives, including the use of futures, swaps and options, to achieve more economically desired market exposures.

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments included in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets are categorized into a fair value hierarchy of three levels, based on the degree of subjectivity inherent in the valuation methodology are as follows:

Level 1 -Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets. 

Level 2 -Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3 -Unobservable prices or inputs.

Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables to permit a reconciliation to total plan assets.

Valuation Methodologies

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Common collective and other trusts - Valued at the net unit value of units held by the trust at year end. The unit value is determined by the total value of fund assets divided by the total number of units of the fund owned. The equity investments in collective trusts are predominantly in index funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. The investments in other trusts are predominantly in exchange traded funds for which the underlying securities are actively traded in public markets based upon readily measurable prices. Common collective and other trusts measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Fixed income securities - These securities consist of publicly traded United States and non-United States fixed interest obligations (principally corporate and government bonds and debentures). The fair value of corporate and government debt securities is determined through third-party pricing models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, credit ratings, and current market prices. The Company verifies the results of trustees or custodians and evaluates the pricing classification of these securities by performing analyses using other third-party sources. 

United States treasuries - Valued at the closing price of each security. 

Real estate - Consists of direct investments in the stock of publicly traded companies and investments in pooled funds that invest directly in real estate. The publicly traded companies are valued based on the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded and as such are classified as Level 1. The pooled funds rely on appraisal-based valuations and as such are classified as Level 3. 

Cash equivalents - Primarily certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and repurchase agreements.

Exchange traded funds - Valued at the closing price of the exchange traded fund's shares.

Money market funds - Money market funds measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

Table of Contents

Other - These assets consist of private equity, private debt, insurance contracts primarily for international plans, futures contracts, and over-the-counter options. Investments in private equity and private debt are valued at net asset value or estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor, third party appraisal or general partner. These estimates incorporate factors such as contributions and distributions, market transactions, market comparables and performance multiples. Futures contracts and options are valued based on the closing prices of contracts or indices as available using third-party sources.

For additional information regarding fair value measurements, see Note 15.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has various defined contribution benefit plans, primarily consisting of the plans in the United States. The total contributions related to these plans are charged to expense and are as follows:

Note 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Legal Contingencies

Eaton is subject to a broad range of claims, administrative and legal proceedings such as lawsuits that relate to contractual allegations and indemnity claims, tax audits, patent infringement, personal injuries, antitrust matters, and employment-related matters. Eaton is also subject to legal claims from historic products which may have contained asbestos. Insurance may cover some of the costs associated with these claims and proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters, the Company believes they will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Contingencies

Eaton has established policies to ensure that its operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and with a positive commitment to the protection of the natural and workplace environments. The Company requires that its businesses be certified to ISO 14001, an international standard for environmental management systems. The Company routinely reviews EHS performance at each of its manufacturing facilities and continuously strives to improve its environmental footprint, including carbon, waste, water and related operational profiles consistent with our sustainability goals.

Eaton is involved in remedial response and voluntary environmental remediation at a number of sites, including certain of its currently-owned or formerly-owned plants. The Company has also been named a potentially responsible party under the United States federal Superfund law, or the state equivalents thereof, at a number of disposal sites. The Company became involved in these sites as a result of government action or in connection with business acquisitions. At the end of 2024, the Company was involved with a total of 108 sites worldwide, including the Superfund sites mentioned above, with none of these sites being individually significant to the Company.

Remediation activities, generally involving soil and/or groundwater contamination, include pre-cleanup activities such as fact finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study, design and action planning, performance (where actions may range from monitoring, to removal of contaminants, to installation of longer-term remediation systems), and operation and maintenance of a remediation system. The extent of expected remediation activities and costs varies by site. A number of factors affect the cost of environmental remediation, including the number of parties involved at a particular site, the determination of the extent of contamination, the length of time the remediation may require, the complexity of environmental regulations, and the continuing advancement of remediation technology. Taking these factors into account, Eaton has estimated the costs of remediation, which will be paid over a period of years. The Company accrues an amount on an undiscounted basis, consistent with the estimates of these costs, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an accrual totaling $70 million and $71 million, respectively, for these costs.

Based upon Eaton's analysis and subject to the difficulty in estimating these future costs, the Company expects that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters is not reasonably possible to exceed the recorded liability by an amount that would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Warranty Accruals

Product warranty accruals are established at the time the related sale is recognized through a charge to Cost of products sold. Warranty accrual estimates are based primarily on historical warranty claim experience and specific customer contracts. Provisions for warranty accruals are comprised of basic warranties for products sold, as well as accruals for product recalls and other events when they are known and estimable. A summary of the current and long-term warranty accruals is as follows:

During 2024, income tax expense of $768 million was recognized (an effective tax rate of 16.8%) compared to income tax expense of $604 million in 2023 (an effective tax rate of 15.8%) and income tax expense of $445 million in 2022 (an effective tax rate of 15.3%). The increase in the effective tax rate from 15.8% in 2023 to 16.8% in 2024 was due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a larger impact from the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based payments and the reduction of valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes. The increase in the effective tax rate from 15.3% in 2022 to 15.8% in 2023 was due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the reduction of valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes.

No provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $33.1 billion at December 31, 2024, since it is the Company's intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company expects to deploy capital to those markets which offer particularly attractive growth opportunities. The cash that is permanently reinvested is typically used to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.

Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine its income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.

Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax income in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments, or changes in tax laws, would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax losses in a particular jurisdiction in the three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, carryback capability under the tax law in the particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company's goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance.

Applying the above methodology, valuation allowances have been established for certain deferred income tax assets to the extent they are not expected to be realized within the particular tax carryforward period.

Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates and adjusts the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits based on changes in facts and circumstances. The Company does not enter into any of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Listed Transactions as set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.6011-4.

If all unrecognized income tax benefits were recognized, the net impact on the provision for income tax expense would be $936 million.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eaton had accrued approximately $225 million and $188 million, respectively, for the payment of worldwide interest and penalties, which are not included in the table of unrecognized income tax benefits above. Eaton recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income tax expense. 

The resolution of the majority of Eaton's unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the timing of finalizing resolutions of audit disputes through reaching settlement agreements or concluding litigation, or changes in law. Therefore, for the majority of Eaton’s unrecognized income tax benefits, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the next 12 months. For each of the unrecognized income tax benefits where it is possible to estimate the increase or decrease in the balance within the next 12 months, the Company does not anticipate any significant change.

The Company believes that the final resolution of all the assessments discussed below will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty given the complex nature of tax controversies. Should the ultimate outcome of any one of these matters deviate from our reasonable expectations, final resolution may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, Eaton believes that its interpretations of tax laws and application of tax laws to its facts are correct, and that its accrual of unrecognized income tax benefits is appropriate with respect to these matters.

Eaton or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in Ireland and many countries around the world. With only a few exceptions, Eaton and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to examinations for years before 2014.

Brazil Tax Years 2005-2012

The Company has two Brazilian tax cases primarily relating to the amortization of certain goodwill generated from the acquisition of third-party businesses and corporate reorganizations. One case involves tax years 2005-2008 (Case 1), and the other involves tax years 2009-2012 (Case 2). Case 2 is proceeding on a more accelerated timeline than Case 1. For Case 2, the Company received a tax assessment in 2014 that included interest and penalties. In November 2019, the Company received an unfavorable result at the final tax administrative appeals level, resulting in an alleged tax deficiency of $21 million plus $100 million of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2024 exchange rate). The Company is challenging this assessment in the judicial system and, on April 18, 2022, received an unfavorable decision at the first judicial level. On April 27, 2022, the Company filed a motion for clarification relating to that decision. On May 20, 2022, the court largely upheld its prior decision without further clarification. On June 9, 2022, the Company filed its notice of appeal to the second level court. On July 11, 2024, the court published a favorable decision resulting in the cancellation of an additional 75% penalty imposed by the tax authorities. As a result of the favorable decision, the alleged interest and penalties was reduced from $100 million to $71 million (translated at the December 31, 2024 exchange rate). The Company intends to continue its challenge of the assessment in the judicial system. 

As previously disclosed for Case 1, the Company received a separate tax assessment alleging a tax deficiency of $27 million plus $99 million of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2024 exchange rate), which the Company is challenging in the judicial system. On April 4, 2024, the court published a favorable decision resulting in a reduction to the Case 1 assessment for the goodwill generated from the acquisition of a third-party business. In the same decision, the court confirmed the cancellation of an additional 75% penalty imposed by the tax authorities. As a result of the favorable decision, the alleged tax deficiency was reduced to $25 million plus $79 million of interest and penalties (translated at the December 31, 2024 exchange rate). The remainder of Case 1 is still pending resolution at the first judicial level.

Both cases are expected to take several years to resolve through the Brazilian judicial system and require provision of certain assets as security for the alleged deficiencies. As of December 31, 2024, the Company pledged Brazilian real estate assets with net book value of $16 million and provided additional security in the form of bank secured bonds and insurance bonds totaling $114 million and a cash deposit of $22 million (translated at the December 31, 2024 exchange rate).

United States Tax Disputes

The IRS typically audits large corporate taxpayers on a continuous basis, generally resulting in many open tax years if there are disputed tax positions upon completion of the audits. The IRS has completed its examination of the consolidated income tax returns of the Company’s United States subsidiaries (Eaton US) for 2007 through 2016 and the statuses of the various tax years are discussed below. The IRS has challenged certain tax positions of Eaton US, and the Company is attempting to resolve those issues in litigation and the IRS administrative process, as described in more detail below. The IRS is currently examining tax years 2017 through 2019, and the statute of limitations for those years is open until June 30, 2026. Tax years 2020 and later are subject to future examination by the IRS. Income tax returns of states and localities within the United States will be reopened to the extent of United States federal income tax adjustments. For some states and localities, the statute of limitations is open as early as the 2007 tax year. The Eaton US tax positions challenged by the IRS are items that recur beyond the tax years for which the IRS has proposed adjustments. Eaton believes that its interpretations of tax laws and application of tax laws to its facts are correct. However, if there is a final unfavorable resolution of any of the issues discussed below, it may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

U.S. Tax Years 2007-2010

In 2014, the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for Eaton US for the 2007 through 2010 tax years (the 2007-10 Notice), which Eaton US contested in Tax Court. The 2007-10 Notice proposed assessments of $190 million in additional taxes plus $72 million in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertained to: (i) transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the Company's facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the United States, and (ii) the separate proposed assessment noted below. The proposed assessment in the 2007-10 Notice for transfer pricing adjustments has been resolved in Tax Court. Eaton US set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that Eaton US sells such products to third parties as required by two successive Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) Eaton US entered into with the IRS that governed the 2005-2010 tax years. Eaton US has continued to apply the APA pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period. In 2011, the IRS sent a letter to Eaton stating that it was retrospectively canceling the APAs. The issue in Tax Court involved whether the IRS improperly cancelled the APAs. On July 26, 2017, the Tax Court issued a ruling in which it agreed with Eaton US that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs for the tax years 2005-2006. On May 24, 2021, the IRS filed a notice to appeal the Tax Court’s ruling to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In July 2022, the Sixth Circuit panel heard oral arguments, and on August 25, 2022, issued a ruling in favor of Eaton US, confirming that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling for tax years 2005-2006 also resolved the APA cancellation issue for the 2007-2010 years. The ruling on the APA issue did not have a material impact on Eaton’s consolidated financial statements. Eaton and the IRS recognized that the ruling on the enforceability of the APA did not address a secondary issue regarding the transfer pricing for a certain royalty paid from 2006-2010. On November 15, 2023, the IRS also agreed to use the royalty rate reported by Eaton for the 2007-2010 tax years. On October 21, 2024, the IRS confirmed to the Tax Court that the Company was not liable for penalties related to the APA cancellation issue.

The 2007-10 Notice also included a separate proposed assessment involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US’s controlled foreign corporations. The Company believes that the proposed assessment is without merit and contested the matter in Tax Court. In October 2017, Eaton and the IRS both moved for partial summary judgment on this issue. On February 25, 2019, the Tax Court granted the IRS’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied Eaton’s. The Company intends to appeal the Tax Court’s partial summary judgment decision to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The total potential impact of the Tax Court's partial summary judgment decision on the controlled foreign corporation income recognition issue is not estimable until all matters in the open tax years have been resolved.

U.S. Tax Years 2011-2013

In 2018, the IRS completed its examination of Eaton US for tax years 2011 through 2013 and proposed adjustments. Those adjustments were the subject of administrative appeals, which concluded without resolution. As a result, on December 21, 2022, the IRS issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency for Eaton US for these tax years (the 2011-2013 Notice) proposing assessments of $749 million in additional taxes plus $110 million in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertain to: (i) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2007-10 Notice for products manufactured in the Company’s facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; (ii) adjustments involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US’s controlled foreign corporations; (iii) transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in one of the Company’s facilities in Mexico and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; and (iv) adjustments challenging the appropriate interest rate on intercompany debt and amount of intercompany fees charged for financial guarantees on external debt. On March 3, 2023, the Company filed its petition to the U.S. Tax Court. The Company will vigorously defend its positions through litigation, which will take several years for final resolution.

U.S. Tax Years 2014-2016

In 2021, the IRS completed its examination of Eaton US for tax years 2014 through 2016 and has proposed adjustments, including: (i) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2007-10 and 2011-2013 Notices for products manufactured in the Company’s facilities in Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; (ii) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2011-2013 Notice for products manufactured in one of the Company’s facilities in Mexico and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; and (iii) adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2011-2013 Notice challenging the appropriate interest rate on intercompany debt and amount of intercompany fees charged for financial guarantees on external debt. On November 29, 2021, the case was formally assigned to administrative appeals, and the Company will attempt to resolve certain of the issues in this administrative forum. However, if acceptable resolutions are not achieved, the Company will vigorously defend its positions through litigation, which if undertaken will likely take several years for final resolution. The statute of limitations on these tax years currently remains open until June 30, 2026.

Note 13. EATON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

There are 750 million Eaton ordinary shares authorized ($0.01 par value per share), 392.9 million and 399.4 million of which were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Eaton's Memorandum and Articles of Association authorized 40 thousand deferred ordinary shares (€1.00 par value per share) and 10 thousand preferred A shares ($1.00 par value per share), all of which were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and 10 million serial preferred shares ($0.01 par value per share), none of which is outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023. At December 31, 2024, there were 9,117 holders of record of Eaton ordinary shares. Additionally, 13,949 current and former employees were shareholders through participation in the Eaton Savings Plan, the Eaton Personal Investment Plan, or The Eaton Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan.

On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for repurchases of ordinary shares up to $5.0 billion to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2022 Program). Under the 2022 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During 2024 and 2022, 7.8 million and 2.0 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2022 Program in the open market at a total cost of $2.5 billion and $286 million, respectively. During 2023, no ordinary shares were repurchased. On February 27, 2025, the Board of Directors renewed the 2022 Program by providing authority for up to $9.0 billion in repurchases to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2025 Program).

Eaton has deferral plans that permit certain employees and directors to defer a portion of their compensation. A trust contains $3 million of ordinary shares and marketable securities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 to fund a portion of these liabilities. The marketable securities were included in Other assets and the ordinary shares were included in Shareholders' equity at historical cost. 

On February 27, 2025, Eaton's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per ordinary share, an 11% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend is payable on March 28, 2025 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2025.

Net Income Per Share Attributable to Eaton Ordinary Shareholders

A summary of the calculation of net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders is as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | | | |   
(In millions except for per share data)| | | | | 2024| | 2023| | 2022

Basic| | | | | 9.54 | | | 8.06 | | | 6.17 |   

In 2024 and 2023, all stock options were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders because they were all dilutive. In 2022, 0.1 million of stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders because the exercise price of the options exceeded the average market price of the ordinary shares during the period and their effect, accordingly, would have been antidilutive.

Note 14. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Eaton recognizes equity-based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award. Awards with service conditions or both service and market conditions are expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Awards with both service and performance conditions are expensed over the period an employee is required to provide service based on the number of units for which achievement of the performance objective is probable. The Company estimates forfeitures as part of recording equity-based compensation expense. 

Restricted Stock Units and Awards

Restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs) have been issued to certain employees and directors. The fair value of RSUs and RSAs are determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant. The RSUs entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share for each RSU upon vesting, generally over three years. RSAs are issued and outstanding at the time of grant, but remain subject to forfeiture until vested, generally over ten years. A summary of the RSU and RSA activity for 2024 is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(Restricted stock units and awards in millions)| Number of restricted  
stock units and awards| | Weighted-average fair

After-tax expense for RSUs and RSAs| 58 | | | 51 | | | 51 |   
Fair value of vested RSUs and RSAs | 126 | | | 84 | | | 98 |   

As of December 31, 2024, total compensation expense not yet recognized related to non-vested RSUs and RSAs was $93 million, and the weighted-average period in which the expense is expected to be recognized is 2.3 years. Excess tax benefit for RSUs and RSAs totaled $8 million, $4 million, and $5 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Performance Share Units

Performance share units (PSUs) have been issued to certain employees that vest based on the satisfaction of a three-year service period and total shareholder return relative to that of a group of peers. Awards earned at the end of the three-year vesting period range from 0% to 200% of the targeted number of PSUs granted based on the ranking of total shareholder return of the Company, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to a defined peer group of companies. Equity-based compensation expense for these PSUs is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Upon vesting, dividends that have accumulated during the vesting period are paid on earned awards. 

The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of PSUs with market conditions. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing these PSUs include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent 3-year period as of the grant date) and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon bonds with a three-year maturity as of the grant date). A summary of the assumptions used in determining fair value of these PSUs is as follows:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | 2024| | 2023| | 2022

Stock Options

Under various plans, stock options have been granted to certain employees and directors to purchase ordinary shares at prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant. Substantially all of these options vest ratably during the three-year period following the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized for stock options based on the fair value of the options at the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period the employee or director is required to provide service.

The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing stock options include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent historical period equal to the expected life of the option); the expected option life (an estimate based on historical experience); the expected dividend yield; and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option).

Note 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy is established, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

A summary of financial instruments and contingent consideration recognized at fair value, and the fair value measurements used, is as follows:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Eaton values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

On March 22, 2021, Eaton acquired Green Motion SA, a leading designer and manufacturer of electric vehicle charging hardware and related software based in Switzerland. Green Motion SA was acquired for $106 million, including $49 million of cash paid at closing and an initial estimate of $57 million for the fair value of contingent future consideration based on 2023 and 2024 revenue performance. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is estimated by discounting contingent payments expected to be made, and may increase or decrease based on changes in revenue estimates and discount rates, with a maximum possible undiscounted value of $113 million. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the contingent future payments has been reduced to $6 million based primarily on lower revenue in 2023 and 2024 compared to the initial estimates at closing. This reduction is presented in Other income - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Other Fair Value Measurements

Long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt had a carrying value of $9,152 million and fair value of $8,651 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $9,261 million and $8,924 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The fair value of Eaton's debt instruments was estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.

Note 16. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

In the normal course of business, Eaton is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, currency forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations. The instruments used by Eaton are straightforward, non-leveraged instruments. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated as part of a hedging relationship, is effective and the nature of the hedging activity. Eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability, specific firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment in a foreign operation. These financial instruments can be designated as:

•Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixed-rate asset or liability, or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability (a fair value hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of change in fair value.

•Hedges of the variable cash flows of a recognized variable-rate asset or liability, or the forecasted acquisition of such an asset or liability (a cash flow hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in income.

•Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income.

The gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge is classified in the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The cash flows resulting from these financial instruments are classified in operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

For derivatives that are not designated as a hedge, any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income. The majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of business. 

Eaton uses currency exchange contracts and certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against foreign currency exposure (net investment hedges). The Company uses the spot rate method to assess hedge effectiveness when currency exchange contracts are used in net investment hedges. Under this method, changes in the spot exchange rate are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Changes related to the forward rate are excluded from the hedging relationship and the forward points are amortized to Interest expense - net on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. The cash flows resulting from these currency exchange contracts are classified in investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Interest Rate Risk

Eaton enters into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk of certain long-term debt. These interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges of certain long-term debt. Eaton also enters into forward starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on future anticipated debt issuances. These are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

A summary of interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2024, is as follows:

The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany receivables, payables and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing 95% to 100% of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations. This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts. The cash flows resulting from the settlement of these derivatives have been classified in investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative net investment hedging instruments had a carrying value on an after-tax basis of $3,105 million and $3,140 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Note 17. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

In the second quarter of 2020, Eaton initiated a multi-year restructuring program to reduce its cost structure and gain efficiencies in its business segments and at corporate in order to initially respond to declining market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the inception of the program, the Company incurred expenses of $199 million for workforce reductions and $184 million for plant closing and other costs, resulting in total charges of $382 million through December 31, 2023. This multi-year restructuring program was substantially complete at the end of 2023, with final payments primarily made in 2024.

During the first quarter of 2024, Eaton implemented a new multi-year restructuring program to accelerate opportunities to optimize its operations and global support structure. These actions will better align the Company's functions to support anticipated growth and drive greater effectiveness throughout the Company. Restructuring charges incurred under this program were $202 million in 2024. This restructuring program is expected to be completed in 2026 and is expected to incur additional expenses related to workforce reductions of $183 million and plant closing and other costs of $90 million, resulting in total estimated charges of $475 million for the entire program.

A summary of restructuring program charges (income) is as follows:

Note 18. GOVERNMENT GRANTS

The Company recognizes the benefit of government grants when they are probable of being received and the specified conditions associated with the grants have been satisfied. Grants for capital investments are generally recognized as deferred income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, then amortized to income over the life of the related assets. Grants for other expenses are recognized as reductions of the related expense over the period incurred.

In 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to receive government grants from a non-Irish government entity. The grants will be recognized over the term of the agreement beginning in 2024 through 2033. The terms of the agreement and the commitments made by the Company and the government entity have been omitted because they are legally prohibited from being disclosed. Under the agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company reduced Selling and administrative expense by $1 million on the Consolidated Statement of Income. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recognized unamortized deferred income of $9 million within Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, government grants did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note 19. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance.

The accounting policies of the business segments are generally the same as the policies described in Note 1, except that, as described further in the following paragraph, certain items are not allocated to the businesses. Intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for at the same prices as if the sales and transfers were made to third parties. These intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation. Operating profit (loss) includes the operating profit from intersegment sales. 

The chief operating decision maker uses segment operating profit (loss) as an input to assess segment performance and determine appropriate resource allocations, including capital, financial, and employee resources. Segment operating profit (loss) results are regularly evaluated versus annual profit plan, forecast and/or prior year.

Other segment items are primarily comprised of Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, Research and development expense, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and certain items included in Other income - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company's chief operating decision maker manages these items on a consolidated basis.

Corporate includes all the Company's amortization of intangible assets, interest expense - net and restructuring program charges (Note 17) and the non-service cost portion of pension and other postretirement benefits income. Other expense - net includes all the Company's costs associated with acquisitions, divestitures, and gains and losses on the sale of certain businesses and other items that are of a corporate or functional governance nature. For purposes of business segment performance measurement, a portion of corporate costs, excluding amortization of intangibles assets, acquisition integration and divestiture costs, and restructuring program charges, are allocated to the businesses. These allocations are periodically adjusted to pass on year-over-year cost savings or increases to the businesses in a manner that is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker assesses performance. Identifiable assets of the business segments exclude goodwill, other intangible assets, and general corporate assets, which principally consist of certain cash, short-term investments, deferred income taxes, certain accounts receivable, certain property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Consolidated Financial Results table below. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they provide additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our business performance and trends, and they allow investors to more easily compare Eaton’s financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton. 

Acquisition and Divestiture Charges

Eaton incurs integration charges and transaction costs to acquire and integrate businesses, and transaction, separation and other costs to divest and exit businesses. Eaton also recognizes gains and losses on the sale of businesses. A summary of these Corporate items is as follows:

Per ordinary share - diluted| $| 0.06 | | | $| 0.10 | | | | | | | $| 0.37 |   

Acquisition integration, divestiture charges and transaction costs are primarily related to acquisitions completed prior to 2023, including other charges and income to acquire and exit businesses, and the reduction in fair value of contingent future consideration from the Green Motion SA acquisition. Costs in 2023 and 2022 also included certain indemnity claims associated with the sale of 50% interest in the commercial vehicle automated transmission business in 2017. Costs in 2022 also included charges of $29 million presented in Other income - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the decision in the second quarter of 2022 to exit the Company's business operations in Russia. These charges consisted primarily of write-downs of accounts receivable, inventory and other assets, and accruals for severance.

Restructuring Programs

In the second quarter of 2020, Eaton initiated a multi-year restructuring program to reduce its cost structure and gain efficiencies in its business segments and at corporate in order to initially respond to declining market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the inception of the program, the Company incurred expenses of $199 million for workforce reductions and $184 million for plant closing and other costs, resulting in total charges of $382 million through December 31, 2023. This restructuring program was substantially complete at the end of 2023 and mature year benefits from the program of approximately $265 million were realized in 2024.

During the first quarter of 2024, Eaton implemented a new multi-year restructuring program to accelerate opportunities to optimize its operations and global support structure. These actions will better align the Company's functions to support anticipated growth and drive greater effectiveness throughout the Company. Restructuring charges incurred under this program were $202 million in 2024. This restructuring program is expected to be completed in 2026 and is expected to incur additional expenses related to workforce reductions of $183 million and plant closing and other costs of $90 million, resulting in total estimated charges of $475 million for the entire program. The Company expects mature year benefits of $375 million when the multi-year program is fully implemented. 

Additional information related to these restructuring programs is presented in Note 17.

Total increase in Net sales| | 7 | %| | | | 12 | %| |   

2024: Organic sales increased 8% in 2024 due to strength in commercial & institutional end-markets in the Electrical Americas business segment, strength in utility end-markets in the Electrical Global business segment, strength in data center end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and military OEM in the Aerospace business segment, and strength in the European region in the eMobility business segment, partially offset by weakness in residential end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments and weakness in the North American and European regions in the Vehicle business segment.

Additionally, during 2024, certain facilities in the Electrical Americas business segment were impacted by Hurricane Helene, and the Aerospace business segment was impacted by industry related labor strikes. These events had a negative impact on Net sales in 2024 of $128 million.

2023: Organic sales increased 12% in 2023 due to strength in commercial & institutional, utility, industrial, and data center end-markets in the Electrical Americas and Electrical Global business segments, strength in sales to commercial OEM and aftermarket in the Aerospace business segment, strength in the North American, European, and Asia Pacific regions in the Vehicle business segment, and the ramp up of key programs in the eMobility business segment due to robust demand for electric vehicles.

Gross Profit

2024: Gross profit margin increased from 36.4% in 2023 to 38.2% in 2024. Material factors affecting this increase were a 290 basis point increase from higher sales and a 90 basis point increase from operating efficiencies, partially offset by a 100 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation and a 70 basis point decline from higher costs to support growth initiatives. 

2023: Gross profit margin increased from 33.2% in 2022 to 36.4% in 2023 primarily due to higher sales volumes and net price realization, partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives in the Electrical Americas and Aerospace business segments, unfavorable product mix in the Electrical Global, Aerospace, and eMobility business segments, and operating inefficiencies in the Electrical Global and Vehicle business segments.

Income Taxes

During 2024, income tax expense of $768 million was recognized (an effective tax rate of 16.8%) compared to income tax expense of $604 million in 2023 (an effective tax rate of 15.8%) and income tax expense of $445 million in 2022 (an effective tax rate of 15.3%). The increase in the effective tax rate from 15.8% in 2023 to 16.8% in 2024 was due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by a larger impact from the excess tax benefits recognized for employee share-based payments and the reduction of valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes. The increase in the effective tax rate from 15.3% in 2022 to 15.8% in 2023 was due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by the reduction of valuation allowances on foreign tax attributes.

Despite OEM delays in electric vehicle rollouts due to weaker than expected customer demand, organic sales increased in 2024 due to strength in the European region, partially offset by weakness in the North American region. The increase in organic sales in 2023 reflects the ramp up of key programs due to robust demand for electric vehicles in the North American and European markets.

The operating margin increased from negative 3.2% in 2023 to negative 1.0% in 2024. Material factors affecting this increase were a 510 basis point increase from operating efficiencies, a 350 basis point increase from higher sales, and a 220 basis point increase from the sale of a non-production facility in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 320 basis point decline from higher costs to support growth initiatives, a 300 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix, and a 220 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation. The operating margin decreased from negative 1.6% in 2022 to negative 3.2% in 2023 primarily due to commodity and wage inflation, manufacturing start-up costs associated with new electric vehicle programs, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by higher sales volumes including inflationary pricing recovery.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Financial Condition

Eaton’s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk. 

On May 21, 2024, a subsidiary of Eaton issued Euro denominated notes (2024 Euro Notes) with a face value of €1,000 million ($1,084 million), in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2024 Euro Notes are comprised of 2 tranches of €500 million each, which mature in 2031 and 2036, with interest payable annually at a respective rate of 3.601% and 3.802%. The issuer received proceeds totaling €995 million ($1,079 million) from the issuance, net of financing costs. The 2024 Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The 2024 Euro Notes contain customary optional redemption and par call provisions. The 2024 Euro Notes also contain a change of control provision which requires the Company to make an offer to purchase all or any part of the 2024 Euro Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The capitalized deferred financing fees are amortized in Interest expense - net over the respective terms of the 2024 Euro Notes. The 2024 Euro Notes are subject to customary non-financial covenants.

On September 30, 2024, the Company replaced its existing $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility with a new $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility that will expire on September 29, 2025. The Company also has a $2,500 million five-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 1, 2027. The revolving credit facilities totaling $3,000 million are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding under Eaton’s revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2024. The Company maintains access to the commercial paper markets through its $3,000 million commercial paper program, of which none was outstanding on December 31, 2024. In addition to the revolving credit facilities, the Company also had available lines of credit of $938 million from various banks primarily for the issuance of letters of credit, of which there was $420 million outstanding at December 31, 2024.

Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments, and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eaton had cash of $555 million and $488 million, short-term investments of $1,525 million and $2,121 million, respectively, with no short-term debt as of December 31, 2024 and $8 million as of December 31, 2023. Eaton has investment grade credit ratings from the two major rating agencies as reflected in the following ratings assigned to its debt:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Credit Rating Agency (long- /short-term rating)| | Rating| | Outlook  
Standard & Poor's| | A-/A-2| | Stable outlook  
Moody's| | A3/P-2| | Stable outlook  
| | | |   

Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, availability under existing revolving credit facilities, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt.

For additional information on financing transactions and debt, see Note 9.

Eaton’s credit facilities and indentures governing certain long-term debt contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit facilities for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. At Eaton’s present credit rating level, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of secured debt (or lease payments due under a sale and leaseback transaction) to adjusted consolidated net worth (or consolidated net tangible assets, in each case as defined in the relevant credit agreement or indenture) may not exceed 10%. Eaton's actual ratios are substantially below the required threshold. In addition, Eaton was in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.

Total increase (decrease) in cash| $| 67 | | | | | $| 194 | | | | | $| (3)|   

Operating Cash Flow

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $703 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The material factor affecting this increase was higher net income of $575 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,091 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to lower investment in working capital and higher net income in 2023.

Investing Cash Flow

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $2,304 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Material factors affecting this decrease were sales of short-term investments of $575 million in 2024 compared to purchases of short-term investments of $1,861 million in 2023, partially offset by payments for settlement of currency exchange contracts not designated as hedges of $3 million in 2024 compared to proceeds from settlement of currency exchange contracts not designated as hedges of $92 million in 2023.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,375 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in the use of cash was primarily driven by an increase in net purchases of short-term investments to $1,861 million in 2023 from $19 million in 2022, and an increase in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment to $757 million in 2023 from $598 million in 2022, partially offset by no cash paid for business acquisitions in 2023 compared to cash paid of $610 million in 2022. 

Financing Cash Flow

Net cash used in financing activities increased by $3,065 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Material factors affecting this increase were an increase in repurchase of shares to $2,492 million in 2024 compared to no repurchase of shares in 2023, and an increase in payments on borrowings to $1,015 million in 2024 from $19 million in 2023, partially offset by a decrease in net payments of short-term debt to $8 million in 2024 from $311 million in 2023, and an increase in proceeds from borrowings to $1,084 million in 2024 from $818 million in 2023.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $469 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in the use of cash was primarily due to lower payments on borrowings of $19 million in 2023 compared to $2,012 million in 2022, and no repurchase of shares in 2023 compared to repurchase of shares of $286 million in 2022, partially offset by net payments of short-term debt of $311 million in 2023 compared to net proceeds of short-term debt of $317 million in 2022 and lower proceeds from borrowings of $818 million in 2023 compared to $1,995 million in 2022.

Uses of Cash

Purchases of Goods and Services

The Company purchases goods and services in the normal course of business based on expected usage. For certain purchases, the Company enters into purchase obligations with various vendors, which include short-term and long-term commitments for purchases of raw materials, outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders, releases under blanket purchase orders, and commitments under ongoing service arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has purchase obligations to support the operation of its business similar to those included in historical cash flow trends.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $808 million, $757 million, and $598 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company plans to increase capital expenditures over the next several years to expand production capacity across various markets to support anticipated growth. As a result, Eaton expects approximately $900 million in capital expenditures in 2025.

Dividends

Cash dividend payments were $1,500 million, $1,379 million and $1,299 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. On February 27, 2025, Eaton's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per ordinary share, an 11% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend is payable on March 28, 2025 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2025. Payment of quarterly dividends in the future depends upon the Company’s ability to generate net income and operating cash flows, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by the Eaton Board of Directors. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2025.

Share Repurchases

On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for repurchases of ordinary shares up to $5.0 billion to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2022 Program). Under the 2022 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During 2024 and 2022, 7.8 million and 2.0 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2022 Program in the open market at a total cost of $2.5 billion and $286 million, respectively. During 2023, no ordinary shares were repurchased. During 2022, 2.0 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2022 Program in the open market at a total cost of $286 million. The Company will continue to pursue share repurchases in 2025 depending on market conditions and capital levels. On February 27, 2025, the Board of Directors renewed the 2022 Program by providing authority for up to $9.0 billion in repurchases to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2025 Program).

Acquisition of Businesses and Investments in Associate Companies

The Company paid cash of $50 million and $610 million to acquire businesses in 2024 and 2022, respectively. There were no business acquisitions in 2023. The Company paid cash of $70 million, $68 million, and $42 million for investments in associate companies in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company will continue to focus on deploying its capital toward businesses that provide opportunities for higher growth and strong returns, and align with secular trends and its power management strategies.

Debt

The Company manages a number of short-term and long-term debt instruments, including commercial paper. At December 31, 2024, the Company had no Short-term debt, Current portion of long-term debt of $674 million, and Long-term debt of $8,478 million. The Company believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, and access to capital markets to meet scheduled payments of long-term debt. For additional information on financing transactions and debt see Note 9.

Leases

See Note 8 for maturities of lease liabilities.

Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

At December 31, 2024, the gross unrecognized income tax benefits totaled $1,361 million and interest and penalties were $225 million. Eaton cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. For additional information about income taxes see Note 12.

Defined Benefits Plans

Pension Plans

During 2024, the fair value of plan assets in the Company’s employee pension plans decreased $244 million to $3,993 million at December 31, 2024. The decrease in plan assets was primarily due to benefit payments and negative currency translation exceeding contributions and asset performance. At December 31, 2024, the net unfunded position of $570 million in pension liabilities consisted of $574 million in plans that have no funding requirements and $227 million in plans that require funding, offset by $231 million in plans that are overfunded. 

Funding requirements are a major consideration in making contributions to Eaton’s pension plans. With respect to the Company’s pension plans worldwide, the Company intends to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulations. In 2024, $110 million was contributed to the pension plans. The Company anticipates making $101 million of contributions to certain pension plans during 2025. The funded status of the Company’s pension plans at the end of 2025, and future contributions, will depend primarily on the actual return on assets during the year and the discount rate used to calculate certain benefits at the end of the year. For additional information about pension plans see Note 10

Supply Chain Finance Program

A third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at the supplier’s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. The SCF program does not have a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity as payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. For additional information on the SCF program, see Note 7. 

Guaranteed Debt

Issuers, Guarantors and Guarantor Structure 

Eaton Corporation has issued senior notes pursuant to indentures dated April 1, 1994 (the 1994 Indenture), November 20, 2012 (the 2012 Indenture), September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Indenture) and August 23, 2022 (as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures of the same date and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2023, the 2022 Indenture). The senior notes of Eaton Corporation are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Registered Senior Notes). Eaton Capital Unlimited Company, a subsidiary of Eaton, is the issuer of five outstanding series of debt securities sold in offshore transactions under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act (the Eurobonds). The Eurobonds and the Registered Senior Notes (together, the Senior Notes) comprise substantially all of Eaton’s long-term indebtedness.

Substantially all of the Senior Notes (with limited exceptions), together with the credit facilities described above under Liquidity and Financial Condition (the Credit Facilities), are guaranteed by Eaton and 17 of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, they rank equally with each other. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Eaton and its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, Eaton has no material, long-term secured debt. The guaranteed Registered Senior Notes are also structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Eaton's subsidiaries that are not guarantors. Except as described below under Future Guarantors, Eaton is not obligated to cause its subsidiaries to guarantee the Registered Senior Notes. 

The table set forth in Exhibit 22 filed with the Form 10-K filed on February 23, 2023 (10-K Exhibit 22) details the primary obligors and guarantors with respect to the guaranteed Registered Senior Notes.

Terms of Guarantees of Registered Securities

Payment of principal and interest on the Registered Senior Notes is guaranteed, on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis by the subsidiaries of Eaton set forth in the table referenced in the 10-K Exhibit 22. Each guarantee is full and unconditional, and joint and several. Each guarantor’s guarantee is an unsecured obligation that ranks equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes are subject to a customary savings clause or similar provision designed to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise legally impermissible or voidable obligation.

Though the terms of the indentures vary slightly, generally, each guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes by a guarantor that is a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation provides that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to:

(a)the consummation of certain types of transactions permitted under the applicable indenture, including one that results in such guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; and 

(b)for Registered Senior Notes issued under the 2022 Indenture, when such guarantor is a guarantor or issuer of indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of less than 25% of our total outstanding indebtedness.

Further, each guarantee by a direct or indirect parent of Eaton Corporation (other than Eaton) provides that it will also be released if:

(c)such guarantee (so long as the guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligations), becomes prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or by any contractual obligation; or 

(d)such guarantee results in material adverse tax consequences to Eaton or any of its subsidiaries (so long as the applicable guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligation).

The guarantee of Eaton does not contain any release provisions.

Future Guarantors

The 2012 and 2017 Indentures generally provide that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under any series of debt securities or a syndicated credit facility. Further, the 2012 and 2017 Indentures provide that any entity that becomes a direct or indirect parent entity of Eaton Corporation and holds any material assets, with certain limited exceptions, or owes any material liabilities must become a guarantor. The 2022 Indenture provides only that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of 25% of the Parent and its Subsidiaries’ then-outstanding indebtedness.

The 1994 Indenture does not contain provisions with respect to future guarantors.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may involve the exercise of significant judgment. For any estimate or assumption used, there may be other reasonable estimates or assumptions that could have been used. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other such estimates and assumptions would have caused materially different amounts to have been reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when control of promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. The majority of the Company’s sales agreements contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. For agreements with multiple performance obligations, judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes. In these types of agreements, we generally allocate sales price to each distinct obligation based on the price of each item sold in separate transactions.

Table of Contents

Due to the nature of the work required to be performed for obligations recognized over time, Eaton estimates total costs by contract. The estimate of total costs are subject to judgment. Estimated amounts are included in the recognized sales price to the extent it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative sales will occur. Additionally, contracts can be modified to account for changes in contract specifications, requirements or sale price. The effect of a contract modification on the sales price or adjustments to the measure of completion under the input method are recognized as adjustments to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis.

Eaton records reductions to sales for returns, and customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates, at the time of the initial sale. Rebates are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The rebate programs offered vary across businesses due to the numerous markets Eaton serves, but the most common incentives relate to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels. Returns are estimated at the time of the sale primarily based on historical experience and recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 3 for additional information.

Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Goodwill

Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and is based on the net assets for each reporting unit, including goodwill and intangible assets. The Company’s reporting units are equivalent to the reportable operating segments, except for the Aerospace segment which has two reporting units. Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit, as this represents the lowest level that constitutes a business and is the level at which management regularly reviews the operating results. The Company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, but may elect to perform a qualitative analysis. 

Additionally, goodwill is evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, specific events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease in share price.

The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a quantitative analysis in 2024, except for the Vehicle and eMobility reporting units which used a qualitative analysis in 2024. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a qualitative analysis in 2023, except for the Vehicle reporting unit which used a quantitative analysis in 2023. A qualitative analysis is performed by assessing certain trends and factors, including projected market outlook and growth rates, forecasted and actual sales and operating profit margins, discount rates, industry data, and other relevant qualitative factors. These trends and factors are compared to, and based on, the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative analysis performed for each reporting unit. The results of the qualitative analyses did not indicate a need to perform quantitative analysis. 

Quantitative analyses were performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model. The model includes estimates of future cash flows, future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. The future cash flows were based on the Company's long-term operating plan and a terminal value was used to estimate the reporting unit's cash flows beyond the period covered by the operating plan. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market holders of a business enterprise. These analyses require the exercise of judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, revenue growth, and margin assumptions. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. 

Based on these analyses performed in 2024 and 2023, the fair value of Eaton's reporting units continue to substantially exceed their respective carrying amounts and thus, no impairment exists.

Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

Indefinite life intangible assets consist of certain trademarks. They are evaluated annually for impairment as of July 1 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis to determine whether their fair values exceed their respective carrying amounts. Indefinite life intangible asset impairment testing for 2024 and 2023 was performed using a quantitative analysis. Determining the fair value of these assets requires significant judgment and the Company uses a royalty relief methodology similar to that employed when the associated assets were acquired, but using updated estimates of future sales, cash flows and profitability. Sensitivity analyses were performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. 

92

* * *

Table of Contents

Additionally, indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include changes in industry and market considerations, cost factors, financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events that could affect inputs used to determine the respective fair values of the indefinite-lived intangible assets.

For 2024 and 2023, the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the respective carrying value.

For additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets see Note 6.

Acquisitions of Businesses

The acquisition of a business is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires assets and liabilities to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date. The initial fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be revised based on the final determination of fair value during the measurement period of up to 12 months from the acquisition date. The Company generally determines the fair value of intangible assets acquired using third-party valuations that are prepared using discounted cash flow models that rely on the Company's estimates. These estimates require judgement of future revenue growth rates, future margins, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount those estimated cash flows. Sensitivity analyses are performed around certain of these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. For additional information about the acquisitions of businesses see Note 2.

Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets

Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine the income tax provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities that have been recognized for differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.

Management evaluates the realizability of deferred income tax assets for each jurisdiction in which it operates. If the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax income in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management normally concludes that the deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realizable and no valuation allowance is recognized, unless known or planned operating developments, or changes in tax laws, would lead management to conclude otherwise. However, if the Company experiences cumulative pre-tax losses in a particular jurisdiction in a three-year period including the current and prior two years, management then considers a series of factors in the determination of whether the deferred income tax assets can be realized. These factors include historical operating results, known or planned operating developments, the period of time over which certain temporary differences will reverse, consideration of the utilization of certain deferred income tax liabilities, carryback capability under the tax law in a particular country, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws, and estimates of future earnings and taxable income using the same assumptions as those used for the Company’s goodwill and other impairment testing. After evaluation of these factors, if the deferred income tax assets are expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period allowed for that specific country, management would conclude that no valuation allowance would be required. To the extent that the deferred income tax assets exceed the amount that is expected to be realized within the tax carryforward period for a particular jurisdiction, management would establish a valuation allowance. For additional information about income taxes see Note 12.

Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

Eaton recognizes an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the benefit would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company evaluates and adjusts the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits based on changes in law, facts and circumstances. Eaton also estimates, where reasonably possible, the increase or decrease in the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits in the next 12 months.

The evaluation and determination of the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions is complex and involves both the exercise of judgement and the utilization of certain estimates and assumptions. Each tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated in light of current tax laws, regulations, and judicial decisions. Additionally, the ultimate resolution of the majority of Eaton’s unrecognized income tax benefits is dependent upon uncontrollable factors such as the timing of finalizing resolutions of audit disputes through reaching settlement agreements or concluding litigation, or changes in law.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans

The measurement of liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans is based on assumptions related to future events including interest rates, return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. Actual plan asset performance will either reduce or increase losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which ultimately affects net income. 

The discount rate for United States plans was determined by discounting the expected future benefit payments using a theoretical zero-coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high-quality bonds as of the measurement date and solving for the single rate that would generate the same benefit obligation. Only corporate bonds with a rating of Aa, determined by averaging the ratings by Moody’s, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, were included. Callable bonds that are not make-whole bonds and certain other non-comparable bonds were eliminated. Finally, a subset of bonds was selected by grouping the universe of bonds by duration and retaining 50% of the bonds that had the highest yields. 

The discount rates for non-United States plans were determined by region and are based on high quality long-term corporate and government bonds. Consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate.

To estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for the vast majority of its defined benefits pension and other postretirement benefits plans, the Company used a spot rate approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period to the relevant projected cash flows.

Key assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement benefits expense are adjusted at each year-end. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets is estimated to have approximately a $49 million effect on pension expense. Likewise, a 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have approximately a $15 million effect on pension expense. A 1-percentage point change in the assumed rate of return on other postretirement benefits assets is estimated to have less than $1 million effect on other postretirement benefits expense. A 1-percentage point change in the discount rate is estimated to have a $3 million effect on expense for other postretirement benefits plans.

Additional information related to changes in key assumptions used to recognize expense for other postretirement benefits plans is found in Note 10.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURE 

On a regular basis, Eaton monitors third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and short-term investments, primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds. The Company diversifies its cash and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Eaton also monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers to mitigate any adverse impact. 

Eaton uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to volatility in raw material costs, currency, and interest rates on certain debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company are straightforward and non-leveraged. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. See Note 16 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments. 

Eaton’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is based on the strength of its credit rating and overall market conditions. During 2024, the Company has not experienced any material limitations in its ability to access these sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2024, Eaton had $3,000 million of long-term revolving credit facilities with banks in support of its commercial paper program. There were no borrowings outstanding under these revolving credit facilities. 

Interest rate risk can be measured by calculating the short-term earnings impact that would result from adverse changes in interest rates. This exposure results from short-term debt, which includes commercial paper at a floating interest rate, floating rate long-term debt, long-term debt that has been swapped to floating rates, and money market investments that have not been swapped to fixed rates. Based upon the balances of investments and floating rate debt at year end 2024, a 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates would have decreased the Company’s net, pre-tax interest expense by $21 million. 

Eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the Company’s financial liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates. Based on Eaton’s best estimate for a hypothetical, 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2024, the market value of the Company’s debt, in aggregate, would decrease by $582 million.

Table of Contents

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to volatility in raw material costs and contractual agreements with suppliers. To partially mitigate this exposure, Eaton enters into commodity contracts for certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations. These commodity contracts are designated for hedge accounting and are generally less than one year in duration. Based on Eaton’s best estimate for a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices the gain or loss would be less than $1 million. The sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months. Any change in the value of the contracts would be offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged transactions.

The Company is exposed to currency risk associated with translating its functional currency financial statements into its reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. Eaton also monitors exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in which the Company operates, and regularly enters into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure. In the aggregate, Eaton’s portfolio of forward contracts related to such transactions was not material to its consolidated financial statements.
