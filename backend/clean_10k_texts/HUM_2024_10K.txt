PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General

Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries, referred to throughout this document as “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Humana,” is committed to putting health first – for our teammates, our customers, and our company. Through our Humana insurance services, and our CenterWell health care services, we make it easier for the millions of people we serve to achieve their best health – delivering the care and service they need, when they need it. These efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, Medicaid, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 16 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 5 million members in our specialty products. During 2024, 85% of our total premiums and services revenue were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 14% derived from our individual Medicare Advantage contracts in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, under which we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 924,800 members as of December 31, 2024.

Humana Inc. was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1964. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, the telephone number at that address is (502) 580-1000, and our website address is www.humana.com. We have made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our web site our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, or 2024 Form 10-K, contains both historical and forward-looking information. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business.

Business Segments

Our two reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers. Our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, utilizes these segment groupings and results of each segment, measured by income (loss) from operations, to assess performance and allocate resources primarily during our annual budget process and periodic forecast updates. For additional information on our business segments and

segment financial information, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Our Products

Our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted. These products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage. Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals, and other providers. Preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, provide members the freedom to choose any health care provider. However, PPOs generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the PPO’s network. Point of Service, or POS, plans combine the advantages of HMO plans with the flexibility of PPO plans. In general, POS plans allow members to choose, at the time medical services are needed, to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network. In addition, we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions, as well as services and capabilities to advance population health. At the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us, engaging members in clinical programs, and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service, or FFS, to a value-based arrangement. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. The discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments.

Medicare

We have participated in the Medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence, offering at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. We have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care. We believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes.

Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and Part B coverage under traditional fee-for-service Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Throughout this document this program is referred to as Medicare FFS. As an alternative to Medicare FFS, in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with CMS pursuant to the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a Medicare Advantage organization under Medicare Part C. Pursuant to Medicare Part C, Medicare Advantage organizations contract with CMS to offer Medicare Advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under Medicare FFS. Our Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans are discussed in the following sections. Prescription drug benefits are provided under Part D.

6

* * *

Individual Medicare Advantage Products

We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits, including wellness programs, chronic care management, and care coordination, to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, and Special Needs Plans, including Dual Eligible Special Needs, or D-SNP, plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. With each of these products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of Medicare FFS, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data analysis techniques to help identify member needs, complex case management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, care management programs, wellness and prevention programs and, in some instances, a reduced monthly Part B premium. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on the following January 1.

Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency situations. Except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan, most HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In some cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program.

Most of our Medicare PFFS plans are network-based products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that Medicare Advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. In these areas, we offer Medicare PFFS plans that have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to Medicare FFS payment rates.

CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service (FFS) program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. For additional information, refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

At December 31, 2024, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 5,661,800 individual Medicare Advantage members, including approximately 924,800 members in Florida. These 

7

* * *

Florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately $16.4 billion, which represented approximately 19% of our individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue, or 14% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Our individual Medicare Advantage products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage products have been renewed for 2025, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2025 have been approved.

Individual Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products

We offer stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D, including a PDP offering co-branded with Walmart Inc., or the Humana-Walmart plan. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on the following January 1. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our PDP bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, titled “Receivables and Revenue Recognition.” Our stand-alone PDP contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare stand-alone PDP products have been renewed for 2025, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2025 have been approved.

We have administered CMS’s Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program since 2010. This program allows individuals who receive Medicare’s low-income subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan. CMS temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both Medicare and Medicaid into the LI-NET prescription drug plan program, and subsequently transitions each member into a Medicare Part D plan that may or may not be a Humana Medicare plan.

Group Medicare Advantage and Medicare Stand-Alone PDP

We offer products that enable employers that provide post-retirement health care benefits to replace Medicare wrap or Medicare supplement products with Medicare Advantage or stand-alone PDPs from Humana. These products are primarily offered as PPO plans on the same Medicare platform as individual Medicare Advantage plans. These plans offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual Medicare plans discussed previously, however, group Medicare Advantage plans typically have richer benefit offerings than individual Medicare Advantage plans, including prescription drug coverage in the gap, for instance, due to the desire of many customers to closely match their pre-retirement benefit structure.

Medicare Supplement

We also offer Medicare supplement products that help pay the medical expenses that Medicare FFS does not cover, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductibles.

8

* * *

State-based Contracts

Through our state-based contracts, we serve members enrolled in Medicaid, a program funded by both the federal and state governments and administered by states to care for their most vulnerable populations. Within federal guidelines, states determine whom to cover, but general categories for traditional Medicaid programs include children and parents; Aged, Blind, and Disabled (ABD) individuals; and Medicaid Expansion adults. Through Medicaid Managed Long-Term Support Services (MLTSS) programs, states offer programs to deliver support services to people who receive home and community or institution-based services for long-term care. 

We have contracts in multiple states to serve Medicaid-eligible members, including Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin.

We also serve members who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, referred to as "dual eligible", through our Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and stand-alone prescription drug plans. As the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of costs, Humana is participating in varied integration models designed to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable costs. 

As part of our individual Medicare Advantage products, we also offer Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNP). In connection with offering a D-SNP in a particular state, we are required to enter into a special coordinating contract with the applicable state Medicaid agency. To meet federal requirements that took effect in 2021, states have implemented new D-SNP requirements to strengthen Medicaid-Medicare integration requirements for D-SNPs. Some states are also moving to support the dual eligible population by linking D-SNP participation to enrollment in a plan that also participates in a state-based Medicaid program to coordinate and integrate both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.

Specialty

We sell specialty and ancillary insurance benefits consisting of dental, vision, life and disability to employer groups. In addition, we sell dental and vision specialty insurance benefits to individuals.

Commercial Fully-Insured and ASO

In February 2023, we announced our planned exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. Following a strategic review, we determined the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support our long-term strategic plans. We anticipate the exit of this line of business to be finalized in the first half of 2025.

For in-force group commercial medical customers and members, our commercial products included a broad spectrum of major medical benefits with multiple in-network coinsurance levels and annual deductible choices that employers of all sizes offered to their employees on either a fully-insured, through HMO, PPO, or POS plans, or self-funded basis. Our plans integrated clinical programs, plan designs, communication tools, and spending accounts. 

Our ASO products were offered to small group and large group employers who self-insured their employee health plans. We received fees to provide administrative services which generally included the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products might have included all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully-insured HMO, PPO, or POS products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers generally retained the risk of financing the costs of health benefits, with large group customers retaining a greater share and small group customers a smaller share of the cost of health benefits. All small group ASO customers and many large group ASO customers purchased stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs.

Military Services

Under our TRICARE contracts with the United States Department of Defense, or DoD, we provide administrative services to arrange health care services for active-duty and retired military personnel and their dependents. We have participated in the TRICARE program since 1996 under contracts with the DoD. Under our contracts, we provide administrative services while the federal government retains all of the risk of the cost of health benefits. Accordingly, we account for revenues under the current contract net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement. 

We delivered services under the T2017 East Region contract from commencement on January 1, 2018 through expiration on December 31, 2024. The T2017 East Region contract comprised 32 states and approximately 6 million TRICARE beneficiaries. In December 2022, we were awarded the next generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support Contracts, or T-5, for the updated TRICARE East Region by the Defense Health Agency of the DoD. The T-5 East Region contract commenced on January 1, 2025 and comprises 24 states, and Washington D.C., and approximately 4.6 million beneficiaries. The transition period for the T-5 contract began in January 2024 and overlapped the final year of the T2017 contract. The length of the contract is one transition year followed by eight annual option periods, which, if all options are exercised, would result in a total contract length of nine years. 

Our CenterWell Segment Products

The products offered by our CenterWell segment are key to our integrated care delivery model. This segment includes our pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions operations. The CenterWell segment also includes our strategic partnerships with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in hospice operations. Services offered by this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. For information on our intersegment revenues, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Pharmacy Solutions

Our pharmacy solutions business includes the operations of CenterWell Pharmacy (our mail-order pharmacy business), CenterWell Specialty Pharmacy, and other retail pharmacies located within CenterWell Primary Care clinics for brand, generic, specialty drugs, over the counter medications and supplies, as well as hospice pharmacy drugs. 

Primary Care

We operate full-service, value-based senior focused primary care centers in a number of states, including Georgia, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia staffed by primary care providers and medical specialists with a primary focus on the senior population under our Primary Care Organization, or PCO. PCO operates these clinics primarily under the Conviva Senior Primary Care and CenterWell Senior Primary Care brands. Our primary care subsidiaries operate our medical center business through both employed physicians and care providers, and through third-party management service organizations with whom we contract to arrange for and manage certain clinical services. PCO currently operates 344 primary care clinics and employs approximately 1,000 primary care providers. PCO serves approximately 390,500 patients, primarily under risk sharing arrangements with Humana Medicare Advantage health plans, third-party Medicare Advantage health plans and CMS administered risk sharing arrangements for Original Medicare.

PCO also operates a Medical Services Organization, or MSO, through Conviva and CenterWell that coordinates medical care for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across multiple states. This MSO provides resources in care coordination, financial risk management, clinical integration and patient engagement that help physicians improve the patient experience as well as care outcomes. PCO’s MSO collaborates with physicians, medical groups and integrated delivery systems to successfully transition to value-based care by engaging, partnering and offering practical services and solutions.

In 2020, our Primary Care Organization entered into a strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, to accelerate the expansion of our primary care model. In May 2022, we established a second strategic partnership with WCAS to develop additional centers between 2023 and 2025. As of December 31, 2024, there were 133 primary care clinics operating under the partnership and we have capacity to open or acquire up to approximately 20 additional centers through the existing partnership agreements.

Provider Arrangements

We provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted, including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers, primary care providers, specialist physicians, dentists, and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities. These ancillary services and facilities include laboratories, ambulance services, medical 

12

* * *

equipment services, home health agencies, mental health providers, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, optical services, and pharmacies. Our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers.

We use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members. These techniques include the coordination of care for our members, product and benefit designs, hospital inpatient management systems, the use of sophisticated analytics, and enrolling members into various care management programs. The focal point for health care services in many of our HMO networks is the primary care provider who, under contract with us, provides services to our members, and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers. Some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met. We have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease. We also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care, asthma related illness, end stage renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and certain other conditions.

We typically contract with hospitals on either (1) a per diem rate, which is an all-inclusive rate per day, (2) a case rate for diagnosis-related groups (DRG), which is an all-inclusive rate per admission, or (3) a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service, ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, or at a discounted charge. APCs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment. These contracts are often multi-year agreements. Outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the Medicare allowable fee schedule.

Our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year, unless either party gives written notice, generally ranging from 90 to 120 days, to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement. Most of the physicians in our PPO networks and some of our physicians in our HMO networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule, which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard Medicare allowable fee schedule.

The terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between Medicare and Medicaid business. A significant portion of our Medicare network contracts, including those with both hospitals and physicians, are tied to Medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies.

Capitation

We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. For some of our medical membership, we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership. Under the typical capitation arrangement, we prepay these providers a monthly fixed-fee per member, known as a capitation (per capita) payment, to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member.

We believe these value-based arrangements represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy. Our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these value-based arrangements with third-party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries.

At December 31, 2024, approximately 2,361,500 members, or 14.4%, of our medical membership, were covered under shared risk value-based arrangements, which provide all member benefits, including 2,114,900 individual Medicare Advantage members, or 38.0%, of our total individual Medicare Advantage membership. 

Physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis. We typically process all claims and measure the financial performance of our capitated providers and require guarantees in certain instances. However, 

13

* * *

we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 304,400 members, including 303,500 individual Medicare Advantage members, or 14.4%, of the 2,114,900 individual Medicare Advantage members covered under shared risk value-based contracts at December 31, 2024, with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits. Capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately $3.6 billion, or 3.6%, of total benefits expense, for the year ended December 31, 2024. We remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services.

Accreditation Assessment

Our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs, including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards. We also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the Health Care Effectiveness Data and Information Set, or HEDIS, which is used by employers, government purchasers and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) to evaluate health plans based on various criteria, including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction.

Providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria, including licensing, patient access, office standards, after-hours coverage, and other factors. Most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by CMS and/or The Joint Commission.

Recredentialing of participating providers occurs every three years, unless otherwise required by state or federal regulations. Recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses, review of their malpractice liability claims histories, review of their board certifications, if applicable, and review of applicable quality information. A committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing.

We maintain accreditation for certain of our health plans and/or departments from NCQA, the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), and/or URAC.

NCQA reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement, population health management, credentialing, utilization management, network management, and member experience. We have achieved and maintained NCQA health plan accreditation in many of our Medicare and Medicaid markets. Humana’s pharmacy organization is accredited by URAC.

Sales and Marketing

We use various methods to market our products, including television, radio, the Internet, telemarketing, wholesale distributors (general agencies) and direct mailings.

At December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,100 sales representatives, as well as approximately 2,700 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of Medicare products, including Medicare Advantage and PDP, and specialty products in our Insurance segment, including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members. We have a marketing arrangement with Walmart Inc., or Walmart, for our individual Medicare stand-alone PDP offering. We also sell group Medicare Advantage products through large employers. In addition, we market our Medicare and individual specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents. For our Medicare products, commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure, regulated in structure and amount by CMS. For our individual specialty products, we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums, with commissions varying by market and premium volume. In addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers, we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics. These include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products. We also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers.

14

* * *

In our Insurance segment, we market our specialty products to individuals through their employers or other groups, which typically offer employees or members a selection of specialty products, pay for all or part of the premiums, and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees. We use licensed independent brokers, independent agents, digital insurance agencies, and employees to sell our specialty products. We pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our specialty products.

Underwriting

Since 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we collectively refer to as the Health Care Reform Law, requires certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without pre-existing condition exclusions or health-status rating adjustments. Accordingly, certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting. Further, underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our individual Medicare, military services, or Medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or medical history.

Competition

The health benefits industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies, national insurance companies, and other HMOs and PPOs. Many of our competitors have a larger membership base and/or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete. Our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

Government Regulation

Diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system, including the Health Care Reform Law at the federal level and laws in certain states limiting the entry of new providers or services though a certificate of need, or CON, process. 

Our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business. We are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted, what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed, when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

For a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

Certain Other Services

Captive Insurance Company

We bear general business risks associated with operating our Company such as professional and general liability, employee workers’ compensation, cybersecurity, and officer and director errors and omissions risks. Professional and general liability risks may include, for example, medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage. We retain certain of these risks through our wholly-owned, captive insurance subsidiary. We reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third-party insurance companies. We remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses.

Centralized Intercompany Services

We provide centralized intercompany services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers. These services include management information systems, product development 

15

* * *

and administration, finance, human resources, accounting, law, public relations, marketing, insurance, purchasing, risk management, internal audit, actuarial, underwriting, claims processing, billing/enrollment, and customer service. Through intercompany service agreements approved, if required, by state regulatory authorities, Humana Inc., our parent company, charges a services fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries to the extent that Humana Inc. is the service provider.

Human Capital Management 

Our associates are essential to our success in delivering on our core strategy, and creating positive healthcare experiences for our members. We are committed to recruiting, developing, and retaining strong and diverse teams. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 65,680 associates.

Our Culture, Engagement and Approach to Work 

We believe that our members’ experience is linked to our associates’ experience and that engaged, productive associates are the key to building a healthy company and a caring environment where our associates go above and beyond for our members, driving innovation, and offering fulfilling experiences that incentivizes them to stay with us over the long-term. We provide opportunities for our associates to add to their personal well-being experiences that go beyond health to enhance their individual need for purpose, belonging and security. With an average tenure of 7 years at our Company, our associates’ loyalty reflects our culture and commitment to growth. We believe that voluntary turnover rate (VTR) is an important indicator of workforce satisfaction as we strive for our associates to choose us over other opportunities. During 2024, our VTR was 14.4%, representing an increase from 13.4% in 2023. 

We regularly measure our success and seek opportunities to advance engagement through an Annual Engagement Survey, or AES, and continuous listening campaigns. Continuous listening involves our proactive solicitation, analysis and response to associate feedback throughout the year by using pulse surveys. By regularly surveying samples of our workforce, we are able to continuously assess our effectiveness and act when needed, which in turn helps to strengthen our culture and support associate engagement. We aim to conduct a confidential, third-party administered AES on an annual basis and encourage all of our associates to participate. The AES is an in-depth survey covering eighteen dimensions that align to the Company’s strategy and employee engagement. We aggregate survey results, provide them to our entire associate population and encourage leaders to use the information to create open, honest action plans with their teams to build upon our collective engagement. 

Pay and Benefits Philosophy, Compensation and Financial Security

We believe all of our associates have the right to receive a competitive wage and we are committed to maintaining a pay and benefits philosophy that is market-based and recognizes an associate’s contributions so that we can attract and retain an engaged, talented team. Further, we believe in fostering a fair and inclusive work environment, one where all associates receive equitable pay for their contributions. Each year, we conduct a comprehensive pay equity/gap analysis to identify and address potential pay disparities between associates performing similar work in similar capacities. Our pay and benefits structure is designed to motivate, incentivize and reward our associates, at all levels of the organization, for their skill development, demonstration of our values and performance. While our programs vary by location, associate type and business, they generally include:

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Relating to Our Business

If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members, lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members, or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, our profitability may be materially adversely affected. We estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments, and design and price our products accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns. These estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends. Accordingly, our reserves may be insufficient.

We use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members, including claims payments, capitation payments to providers (predetermined amounts paid to cover services), estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members, and various other costs. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record benefits payable for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate. However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends. Many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums. These factors may include:

•increased use of medical facilities and services, and the increased cost of such services;

•increased use or cost of prescription drugs, including specialty prescription drugs;

•the introduction of new or costly treatments, prescription drugs, or new technologies; 

•our membership mix;

•variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes;

•changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market;

•changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; 

•changes in our purchase discounts or rebates received from manufacturers and wholesalers;

•pharmacy volume rebates received from drug manufacturers, which in Medicare Part D are fully reported to CMS and factored into member premium pricing and CMS reimbursement to the plan;

•catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), or natural disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes) which could occur more frequently or with more intense effects as a result of the impact of global climate change; 

•medical cost inflation; and

•government mandated benefits, member eligibility criteria, or other legislative, judicial, or regulatory changes.

Key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members, lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members, and appropriately document the risk profile of our members. Our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part 

20

* * *

on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through, among other things, the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program. 

While we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses, increases or decreases in staff-related expenses, any costs associated with exiting products, additional investment in new products (including our opportunities in the Medicare programs, state-based contracts, and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model), investments in health and well-being product offerings, acquisitions, new taxes and assessments, inflation, and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses.

Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

We are in a highly competitive industry. Some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services. We believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors through the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative and regulatory reform, and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical and administrative costs.

The policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plans, military services and Medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability. These governmental policies and decisions, which we cannot predict with certainty, directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs, the eligibility and enrollment of our members, the services we provide to our members, and our administrative, health care services, and other costs associated with these programs. Legislative or regulatory actions, such as changes to the programs in which we participate, those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us, an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services, or additional fees, taxes or assessments, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationships with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into Medicare or commercial markets, or the termination of a large contract. 

If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, if membership declines, or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, including our Medicare initiatives, which are of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products, our state-based contracts strategy, the growth of our CenterWell businesses, and our integrated care delivery model, our business may be materially adversely affected. 

Our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy, including opportunities created by the expansion of our Medicare programs, our strategy with respect to state-based contracts, including those covering members dually eligible for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the growth of our pharmacy, 

21

* * *

primary care, and home solutions businesses, and the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model. 

We have made substantial investments in the Medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs. The growth of our Medicare products is an important part of our business strategy, and the attendant concentration of revenues intensifies the risks to us inherent in Medicare products. Any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

The number of our Medicare Advantage plans rated 4-star or higher will significantly decline in 2025. We have filed a lawsuit seeking to set aside and vacate the 2025 Star Ratings of our Medicare Advantage plans, but there is no assurance that we will prevail in this lawsuit. If we are not successful, the decline in our Star Ratings will negatively impact our 2026 quality bonus payments from CMS and may also significantly adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our Star Ratings in future years.

The achievement of Star Ratings of 4-star or higher qualifies Medicare Advantage plans for premium bonuses. Our Medicare Advantage plans' operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings. Uncertainties with respect to both ongoing changes to the Star Ratings system and CMS cut-points for establishing a plan’s performance with respect to star rating measures, which are not determined until after the relevant measurement period, continue to make accurate prediction of each Medicare Advantage plan’s Star Ratings more challenging. Despite our operational efforts to improve our Star Ratings, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our Star Ratings in future years. In addition, audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings. Accordingly, our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses or may not match the performance of our competitors, each of which could materially and adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer, reduce membership and/or reduce profit margins, which may significantly adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.

Based on 2025 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings released by CMS in October 2024, approximately 25% of our Medicare Advantage members are currently enrolled in plans rated 4-star or higher for 2025, as compared to 94% based on our 2024 Star Ratings. We have filed a lawsuit that, among other things, seeks to set aside and vacate the 2025 Star Ratings for our Medicare Advantage plans, but there is no assurance that we will prevail in the lawsuit. If we are not successful, the decline in our Star Ratings performance for 2025 will negatively impact our 2026 quality bonus payments from CMS and may also significantly adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. Please see “Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters” in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for a description of the lawsuit.

If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, to strategically maintain existing or implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business may be materially adversely affected. 

Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, develop new and innovative products and services (including enhanced technologies that improved connectivity across products and meet consumer expectations for engaging in their health care), automate and deploy new technologies to simplify administrative processes and clinical decision making, provide timely payments to care providers, drive administrative and operational efficiencies, and timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the performance of, and integrity of the data, in our information systems. These systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop and integrate new systems, including systems powered by or incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning (including generative AI) (AI/ML), to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences, and even with such resources there is no assurance that we will be 

22

* * *

able to do so. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate, unreliable, or biased, if we fail to improve service levels or maintain the integrity of our data, or if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems and develop and integrate new systems (including systems powered by or incorporating AI/ML), or if our use of AI/ML technologies were to result in inaccuracies, biases or errors, we could have operational disruptions, problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, customer and health care provider disputes, reputational challenges, regulatory or other legal obstacles (including potential investigations and enforcement), difficulty preventing and detecting fraud, increases in operating expenses, difficulty driving administrative or operational efficiencies to enhance our operations and reduce costs, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, or other adverse consequences, each of which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 

We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. A change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results. 

We rely on our agreements with customers and service providers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. The misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

If we, and the third-party service providers on whom we rely, are unable to defend our information technology systems against cybersecurity attacks, contain such attacks when they occur, or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintentional dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties, liability or reputational damage, or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

In the ordinary course of our business, we process, store and transmit large amounts of data, and rely on third-party service providers to do the same, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a third-party with which we do business. We have been, and will likely continue to be, regular targets of attempted cybersecurity attacks and other security threats and may be, and have been, subject to breaches of our information technology systems, including breaches of the information technology systems of third-party service providers. Although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations, financial position, or cash flow through December 31, 2024, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, or contain the effects of such cybersecurity attacks or other information security risks or threats, or that such an attack will not be material to our business, in the future. Further, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are increasing in sophistication, in part due to use of evolving AI/ML technologies (including generative AI), and because our businesses are changing as well, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and threats, detect data security incidents or implement adequate preventive measures. A cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and lead to the misappropriation of or compromise of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions, cause shutdowns, or deploy viruses, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or those of our third-party service providers. A cybersecurity attack that bypasses our information technology systems, or the security of our third-party service providers, could materially affect us due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential information or intellectual property, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our IT systems, extortion attempts, or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members, customers, providers, and other stakeholders.

23

* * *

The costs to detect, prevent, eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential members. In addition, breaches of our security measures or the security measures of third-party service providers, and the unauthorized dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties, can expose our associates' or customers’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in significant regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.

We are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations, any of which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business.

We are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including breach of contract actions, employment compensation and other labor and employment practice suits, employee benefit claims, stockholder suits and other securities laws claims, intellectual and other property claims, and tort claims.

In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management, and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums; claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments; claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage; challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; claims relating to our administration of our Medicare Part D offerings; medical malpractice actions brought against our employed providers or affiliated physician-owned professional groups, or against our health plans based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for a third-party providers' alleged malpractice; claims arising from any adverse medical consequences resulting from our recommendations about the appropriateness of providers’ proposed medical treatment plans for patients; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over compensation or non-acceptance or termination of provider contracts; false claims litigation, such as qui tam lawsuits, brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that we, as a government contractor, submitted false claims to the government or retained overpayments from the government, among other allegations, resulting from coding and review practices under the Medicare risk-adjustment model; claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; claims relating to customer audits and contract performance; claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our in-house dispensing pharmacies; and professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public.

In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and other statutes may be sought. 

While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance. In some jurisdictions, coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.

The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation, and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate, and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

24

See "Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters" in Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty.

As a government contractor, we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs.

A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare, military services, and Medicaid programs. These programs accounted for approximately 94% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. These programs involve various risks, as described further below.

•At December 31, 2024, under our contracts with CMS we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 924,800 individual Medicare Advantage members in Florida. These contracts accounted for approximately 14% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. The loss of these and other CMS contracts (which are generally renewed annually) or significant changes in the Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug Plan programs as a result of legislative or regulatory action, including changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design (such as the changes to plan sponsor liability across the different Part D coverage phases that will apply beginning in plan year 2025) or reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 

•Our military services business, which accounted for approximately 1% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisted of the TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. We delivered services under the T2017 East Region contract from commencement on January 1, 2018 through expiration on December 31, 2024. The T2017 East Region contract comprised 32 states and approximately 6 million TRICARE beneficiaries. In December 2022, we were awarded the next generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support Contracts, or T-5, for the updated TRICARE East Region by the Defense Health Agency of the DoD. The T-5 East Region contract commenced on January 1, 2025 and comprises 24 states, and Washington D.C., and approximately 4.6 million beneficiaries. The transition period for the T-5 contract began in January 2024 and overlapped the final year of the T2017 contract. The length of the contract is one transition year followed by eight annual option periods, which, if all options are exercised, would result in a total contract length of nine years.

•CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service (FFS) program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we 

25

* * *

conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model.

CMS and the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, or HHS-OIG, perform audits of various companies’ risk adjustment diagnosis data submissions. We refer to these audits as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices that influence the calculation of health status-related premium payments to MA plans. 

In 2012, CMS released an MA contract-level RADV methodology that would extrapolate the results of each CMS RADV audit sample to the audited MA contract’s entire health status-related risk adjusted premium amount for the year under audit. In doing so, CMS recognized “that the documentation standard used in RADV audits to determine a contract’s payment error (medical records) is different from the documentation standard used to develop the Part C risk-adjustment model (FFS claims).” To correct for this difference, CMS stated that it would apply a “Fee-for-Service Adjuster (FFS Adjuster)” as “an offset to the preliminary recovery amount.” This adjuster would be “calculated by CMS based on a RADV-like review of records submitted to support FFS claims data.” CMS stated that this methodology would apply to audits beginning with PY 2011. Humana relied on CMS’s 2012 guidance in submitting MA bids to CMS. Humana also launched a “Self-Audits” program in 2013 that applied CMS’s 2012 RADV audit methodology and included an estimated FFS Adjuster. Humana completed Self-Audits for PYs 2011-2016 and reported results to CMS. 

In October 2018, however, CMS issued a proposed rule announcing possible changes to the RADV audit methodology, including elimination of the FFS Adjuster. CMS proposed applying its revised methodology, including extrapolated recoveries without application of a FFS Adjuster, to RADV audits dating back to PY 2011. On January 30, 2023, CMS published a final rule related to the RADV audit methodology (Final RADV Rule). The Final RADV Rule confirmed CMS’s decision to eliminate the FFS Adjuster. The Final RADV Rule states CMS’s intention to extrapolate results from CMS and HHS-OIG RADV audits beginning with PY 2018, rather than PY 2011 as proposed. However, CMS’s Final RADV Rule does not adopt a specific sampling, extrapolation or audit methodology. CMS instead stated its general plan to rely on “any statistically valid method . . . that is determined to be well-suited to a particular audit.”

We believe that the Final RADV Rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). CMS failed to meet its legal obligations in the federal rulemaking process to give a reasoned justification for the rule or provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment. They also chose to apply the rule retroactively rather than prospectively, as required by law. Humana’s actuarially certified bids through PY 2023 preserved Humana’s position that CMS should apply an FFS Adjuster in any RADV audit that CMS intends to extrapolate. CMS confirmed its intent to apply the Final RADV Rule, including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements without the use of a FFS Adjuster, to CMS audits conducted for PY 2018 and subsequent years when it selected certain of Humana's MA contracts for PY 2018 RADV Audits. The Final RADV Rule, including the lack of a FFS Adjuster, and any related regulatory, industry or company reactions, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

On September 1, 2023, Humana Inc. and Humana Benefit Plan of Texas, Inc. filed suit against the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and Xavier Becerra in his official capacity as Secretary, in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division seeking a determination that the Final RADV Rule violates the APA and should be set aside. We remain committed to working alongside CMS to promote the integrity of the MA program as well as affordability and cost certainty for our members. It is critical that MA plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles, including the application of a FFS Adjuster, are in accordance with the requirements of the 

26

* * *

Social Security Act, which, if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In addition, as part of our internal compliance efforts, we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to, among other things, our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk adjustment model. These reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to CMS that may, either individually or in the aggregate, be material. As such, the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

•Our CMS contracts which cover members’ prescription drugs under Medicare Part D contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk. These provisions, certain of which are described below, affect our ultimate payments from CMS.

The premiums from CMS are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received (known as a “risk corridor”). We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience. The estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain until CMS completes the applicable final payment year reconciliation, including member eligibility differences with CMS incurred allowable drug costs after rebates and other discounts, and low-income subsidy amounts. 

Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent payments from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent payments for CMS’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent payments from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and settlement of CMS’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year. 

Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Our claims data may not pass CMS’s claims edit processes due to various reasons, including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of low-income members. To the extent our data does not pass CMS’s claim edit processes, we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a low-income subsidy or reinsurance claim. In addition, in the event the settlement represents an amount CMS owes us, there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing CMS’s share of the risk. The opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe CMS. Further, legislative or regulatory changes to how actual prescription drug costs are reported or calculated or other changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design may lower reinsurance or low-income cost subsidies paid by CMS and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

•Our primary care and home solutions businesses derive a substantial portion of their revenues from third-party payors and directly from the federal and state governments through participation in fee-for-service Medicare. This concentration of revenues subjects these businesses to reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or changes in the rules governing the Medicare program, including changes to 

27

* * *

CMS’s risk adjustment model that may apply to our primary care business through its contracts with third-party payors. It is reasonably possible that such changes in reimbursement rates or changes to the Medicare programs in which our primary care and home health business participate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

•We are subject to various other governmental audits and investigations. Under state laws, our HMOs and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance. Our HMOs are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health. Audits and investigations, including audits of risk adjustment data, are also conducted by state attorneys general, CMS, HHS-OIG, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency. All of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or temporary or permanent exclusion from participating in various government health care programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products, the imposition of fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions, or changes in our business practices. The outcome of any current or future governmental or internal investigations cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation, penalties, fines or other sanctions could be substantial, and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Certain of these matters could also affect our reputation. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services.

Our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation. New laws or regulations, or legislative, judicial, or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, or cash flows. 

New Laws or Regulations, or Future Legislative, Judicial or Regulatory Changes

We are and will continue to be regularly subject to new laws and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, and judicial determinations that impact the interpretation and applicability of those laws and regulations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we collectively refer to as the Health Care Reform Law), the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the “Families First Act”), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”), and related regulations, are examples of laws which have enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry, including among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values, and changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design.

It is reasonably possible that these laws and regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes, including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network, market and sell our products, or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage business profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, further restrictions on service arrangements and fee payments between intercompany or vertically-integrated assets, increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, or changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design (and uncertainty arising from the implementation of these changes) may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including 

28

* * *

restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.

Additionally, potential legislative changes or judicial determinations, including activities to repeal or replace these laws and regulations, including the Health Care Reform Law or declare all or certain portions of these laws and regulations unconstitutional or contrary to law, create uncertainty for our business, and we cannot predict when, or in what form, such legislative changes or judicial determinations may occur.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act)

The use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers, and seeking protections for the confidentiality and security of patient data. The rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. These regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information, including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to "opt out" of certain disclosures. 

The HITECH Act, one part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, significantly broadened and strengthened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of HIPAA and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI. Among other requirements, the HITECH Act and HIPAA requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI to any impacted individuals and to HHS in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individuals, and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI, requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy and security rule, and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the HHS Office of Civil Rights. 

In addition, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties. Violations of HIPAA or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties, including significant monetary penalties. Compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. HIPAA can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates (e.g., entities that provide services to health plans and providers).

Corporate Practice of Medicine and Other Laws 

As a corporate entity, Humana Inc. is not licensed to practice medicine. Many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals, and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians. Statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary widely from state to state. Under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physician-owned professional groups, these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions, as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers, developing operating policies and procedures, implementing professional standards and controls, and maintaining malpractice insurance. We believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state 

29

* * *

statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, and similar issues. However, any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these statutes, which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business, may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Anti-Kickback, Physician Self-Referral, and Other Fraud and Abuse Laws 

We are subject to various federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws including the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”), the federal “Stark Law,” and related state laws. Potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or other government healthcare programs. The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation, or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of business under Medicare or other governmental health program. The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship, unless the financial relationship fits within a permissible exception.

Many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the Anti-Kickback Statute and, in more limited instances, the Stark Law, that are not limited to services for which Medicare or Medicaid payment is made. In addition, most states have statutes, regulations, or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals. These laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. In states that have enacted these statutes, we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law as persuasive. 

We believe that our operations comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law, and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse. These laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation, and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion. We continually monitor developments in this area. If these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended, or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse, illegal remuneration, or similar issues, we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law. There can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or, if possible, would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

State Regulation of our Products and Services

Laws in each of the states (and Puerto Rico) in which we operate our HMOs, PPOs and other health insurance-related services regulate our operations including: capital adequacy and other licensing requirements, policy language describing benefits, mandated benefits and processes, entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market, rate increases, delivery systems, utilization review procedures, quality assurance, complaint systems, enrollment requirements, claim payments, marketing, and advertising. The HMO, PPO, and other health insurance-related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators.

Our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and Puerto Rico regulations. These regulations generally require, among other things, prior approval and/or notice of new products, rates, benefit changes, and certain material transactions, including dividend payments, purchases or sales of assets, intercompany agreements, and the filing of various financial and operational reports.

Certain of our healthcare services businesses require a Certificate of Need, or CON, to operate in certain states. These states restrict the entry of new providers or services and the expansion of existing providers or services in their state through a CON process, which is periodically evaluated and updated as required by applicable state law. 

30

* * *

To the extent that we require a CON or other similar approvals to expand our operations, our expansion could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain the necessary approval. To the extent laws in these CON states change, including the elimination of the CON requirement, the intangible value associated with these CONs may be impaired.

Any failure by us to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 

As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, divestitures, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, transactions outside of our core business space, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. The failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our transactions may cause asset write-offs, restructuring costs or other expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally. In addition, from time to time, we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic, growth or profitability objectives, and we may divest or wind down such businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us, and the divestiture of certain businesses could result, individually or in the aggregate, in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business may be adversely affected.

We employ or contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. A key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner.

In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician specialty groups, physician/hospital organizations, or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage, or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a cost-effective manner, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected.

In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined, fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members. This type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract. The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with 

31

* * *

other providers. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

The success of our healthcare services businesses depends on our ability, and the ability of our affiliated physician-owned professional groups and management services organizations, to recruit, hire, acquire, contract with, and retain physicians, nurses and other medical professionals who are experienced in providing care services to older adults. The market to acquire or manage physician practices, and to employ or contract with individual physicians, nurses and other medical professionals is, and is expected to remain, highly competitive, and the performance of our healthcare services businesses may be adversely impacted if we, and our affiliated physician-owned professional groups and management services organizations, are unable to attract, maintain satisfactory relationships with, and retain physicians, nurses and other medical professionals, or if these businesses are unable to retain patients following the departure of a physician, nurses or other medical professional. In addition, our healthcare services businesses contract with competitors of our health benefits businesses, and these businesses could be materially impacted if they are unable to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately negotiate the terms of their contracts with these third-party payers, including the price and other terms of fixed fee (or capitated) agreements under which our primary care business assumes the risk that the actual cost of a basket of services provided to a patient exceeds the reimbursement provided by the health plan third-party payers.

We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees. Further, managing succession for, and retention of, key executives is critical to our success, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses, operating results and/or future performance.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, to operate and expand our business. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries. In addition, while we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives, our business, results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected.

Our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations and distribution and supply chain risks in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses.

Our in-house dispensing pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores, retail drugstore chains, supermarkets, discount retailers, membership clubs, internet companies and other mail-order and long-term care pharmacies. 

Our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. The practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy. Many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals, including controlled substances, have laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail-order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy. Federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations, requiring registration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances. In addition, the FDA inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. The U.S. Postal Service, or USPS, has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations. The USPS historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. If the USPS restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. The U.S. Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce. These regulations generally do not apply to the USPS and its operations. In addition, we are subject to CMS rules regarding the administration of our PDP plans and intercompany pricing between our PDP plans and our pharmacy business.

32

* * *

We are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products, including the application of state laws and regulations related to the operation of internet and mail-order pharmacies, violations of which could expose us to civil and criminal penalties, and manufacturing, distribution or other supply chain disruptions (including disruptions that occur as a result of catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, public health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), or natural disasters (such as hurricanes and earthquakes) which could occur more frequently or with more intense effects as a result of the impacts of global climate change), each of which could impact the availability or cost of supplying of such products.

Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance.

Contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs. These benchmarks include average wholesale price, which is referred to as “AWP,” average selling price, which is referred to as “ASP,” and wholesale acquisition cost. It is uncertain whether payors, pharmacy providers, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize AWP as it has previously been calculated, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. Legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulators have conducted investigations into the use of AWP for federal program payment, and whether the use of AWP has inflated drug expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Adoption of ASP in lieu of AWP as the measure for determining payment by Medicare or Medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our in-house dispensing pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.

Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our parent company. Certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these insurance subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, or ordinary dividends, is limited based on the entity's level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. Dividends from our non-insurance companies such as in our CenterWell segment are generally not restricted by Departments of Insurance. In the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Downgrades in our debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Historically, rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to, among other things, perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment in the insurance industry, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current 

33

* * *

ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such. 

We believe that certain of our customers place importance on our claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings, and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded. In addition, our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain future borrowings and investment capital on favorable terms. If our credit ratings were to be lowered, our cost of borrowing likely would increase, our sales and earnings could decrease, and our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets, including changes in interest rates, may significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the investment income that we derive from this portfolio. 

Ongoing volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets, including changes in interest rates, may significantly and adversely affect the value of our significant investment portfolio and the investment income that we derive from this portfolio. We evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. For the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification. For debt securities held, we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, or if a credit loss has occurred. When we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position, potential credit related impairments are considered using a variety of factors, including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the security; changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies; the volatility of the fair value changes; and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. We continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or credit related impairments may be recorded in future periods.

We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares. However, continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, both to the overall market and our industry, our credit ratings and debt capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY

Risk Management and Strategy

In the ordinary course of our business, we process, store and transmit large amounts of data, and rely on third-party service providers to do the same, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a third-party with which we do business. The protection of information and business processes is an integrated component in our overall risk management program, and reflected in our Code of Ethics, security standards, and privacy policies. We employ processes to safeguard information and protect our customers’ data, including by deploying both proactive and defensive practices against the evolving cyber threat landscape. Examples of these processes include:

a.Employing a qualified Chief Information Security Officer.

b.Maintaining tools to identify malicious cyber activity. 

c.Monitoring risks posed by threat actors, including through partnerships with industry groups and government agencies. 

d.Providing annual cybersecurity training to our associates. 

e.Testing our associates’ knowledge through internal phishing simulations. 

f.Engaging an independent third-party audit firm to perform an Annual Service Organizational Controls (SOC) 2 audit of enterprise claims platforms.

g.Reporting data breaches, as required by law, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), and various state agencies; our reports are publicly available, free of charge, and can be obtained through the OCR Portal at https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach.

h.Maintaining a program to identify cybersecurity risks associated with certain third-party vendors, which is one component of an overall vendor risk management program.

We also enhance our information technology infrastructure and security protocols to assess, identify, protect against, and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats following a risk-based approach. In addition, we conduct cybersecurity risk assessments at least annually, and periodically engage an independent auditor or other external assessors to aid in pro-active risk identification, prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation. Our efforts to manage against cybersecurity threats are further guided by Federal and state laws, as well as contractual commitments with third parties, which regulate our collection, use and disclosure of confidential information such as protected health information and personally identifiable information. 

Although we have been subject to breaches of our information technology systems, including breaches of the information technology systems of third-party service providers, the impact of such attacks has not been material to our business strategy, operations or results of operations, financial position, or cash flows through December 31, 2024. We do not believe that cybersecurity threats resulting from any previous cybersecurity incidents of which we are aware are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. For additional information on the risks we face from cybersecurity threats, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

Governance

As part of its overall responsibility for oversight of our enterprise risk management, our Board of Directors reviews material risks to our Company, including risks from cybersecurity threats. The Board has designated our Audit Committee and Technology Committee with joint oversight over our information technology internal controls, cybersecurity, business continuity and disaster recovery programs.

Management is responsible for designing and implementing our governance framework and controls for managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats, under the oversight of our Board of Directors. Our Chief Information Security Officer is responsible for assessing and managing identified cybersecurity risks, evaluating and remediating cybersecurity incidents, and sharing information directly with the Audit Committee and Technology Committee, or full Board of Directors, when appropriate. Our Chief Information Security Officer reports to our 

35

* * *

Chief Information Officer, who is in turn responsible for the management of Humana’s data and information technology risks more generally. Our Chief Information Officer is a senior executive with more than two decades of experience leading technology teams in large, regulated industries. Our Chief Information Security Officer is an experienced cybersecurity executive and leader in the field, with many years of relevant experience working in highly regulated industries.

Among our cybersecurity and risk teams, we utilize established governance mechanisms to enable a transparent and holistic approach to cybersecurity risk management, and the evaluation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. These processes enable cross-functional engagement from our enterprise information protection, enterprise risk management, enterprise compliance, information technology, legal, privacy, and data governance teams. 

As a key component of this governance framework, the Audit Committee and Technology Committee also receive regular updates regarding our cybersecurity program and cybersecurity incidents from our Chief Information Security Officer.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is located in the Humana Building, 500 West Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. In addition to the headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky, we maintain other principal operating facilities used for customer service, enrollment, and/or claims processing and certain other corporate functions in Louisville, Kentucky; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Tampa, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; San Antonio, Texas; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Austin, Texas.

We owned or leased numerous medical centers and administrative offices at December 31, 2024. The medical centers we operate are primarily located in Florida and Texas, including full-service, multi-specialty medical centers staffed by primary care providers and medical specialists. Of these medical centers, approximately 378 of these facilities are leased or subleased to our contracted providers to operate.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, certain of which may be styled as class-action lawsuits. Among other matters, this litigation may include employment matters, claims of medical malpractice, bad faith, nonacceptance or termination of providers, anticompetitive practices, improper rate setting, provider contract rate disputes, qui tam litigation brought by individuals seeking to sue on behalf of the government, failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements, general contractual matters, intellectual property matters, and challenges to subrogation practices. For a discussion of our material legal actions, including those not in the ordinary course of business, see “Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters” in Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

For discussion of 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this 2024 Form 10-K, refer to "Item 7. – Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2024.

Executive Overview

General 

Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is committed to putting health first – for our teammates, our customers, and our company. Through our Humana insurance services, and our CenterWell health care services, we make it easier for the millions of people we serve to achieve their best health – delivering the care and service they need, when they need it. These efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, Medicaid, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large.

Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefit ratio, which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The operating cost ratio, which is computed by taking total operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of total revenue less investment income, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency.

Employer Group Commercial Medical Products Business Exit

In February 2023, we announced our planned exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. No other Humana health plan offerings are materially affected. Following a strategic review, we determined the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support our long-term strategic plans. We anticipate the exit of this line of business to be finalized in the first half of 2025. 

Value Creation Initiatives and Impairment Charges 

In order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expansion of our healthcare services capabilities beginning in 2022, we committed to drive additional value for the enterprise through cost saving, productivity initiatives, and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we recorded charges of $281 million and $436 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily within operating costs in the consolidated statements of income. 

The value creation initiative charges primarily relate to $256 million and $237 million in asset impairments in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as well as $25 million and $199 million in severance charges in connection with workforce optimization in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

In addition, we recorded impairment charges of $200 million, relating to indefinite-lived intangible assets, in 2024 and $91 million, including $55 million relating to indefinite-lived intangible assets, in 2023. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were included within operating costs in our consolidated statements of income with the remaining impairment charges included within investment income.

Further, we recorded severance charges of $70 million in 2023 within operating costs in our consolidated statement of income as a result of our exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business.

COVID-19

The emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business. Initially during periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, a reduction in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions for non-emergent and elective medical care resulted in lower overall healthcare system utilization. At the same time, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization. During 2022, we experienced lower overall utilization of the healthcare system than anticipated, as the reduction in COVID-19 utilization following the increased incidence associated with the Omicron variant outpaced the increase in non-COVID-19 utilization. 

The COVID-19 National Emergency declared in 2020 was terminated on April 10, 2023 and the Public Health Emergency expired on May 11, 2023.

Business Segments

Our two reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. Our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, utilizes these segment groupings and results of each segment, measured by income (loss) from operations, to assess performance and allocate resources primarily during our annual budget process and periodic forecast updates. For segment financial information, refer to Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

The Insurance segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts, as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. This segment also includes products consisting of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO. In addition, our Insurance segment includes our Military services business, primarily our T-2017 East Region contract, as well as the operations of our PBM business. 

The CenterWell segment includes our pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions operations. The segment also includes our strategic partnerships with WCAS to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in hospice operations. Services offered by this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. 

Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of products and services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded primarily at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations.

Seasonality

One of the product offerings of our Insurance segment is Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDP, under the Medicare Part D program. Our quarterly Insurance segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare 

42

* * *

Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period, which begins annually on January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result, the PDP benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low income senior members as well as year-over-year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern. Beginning in 2025, changes to Part D under the Inflation Reduction Act are expected to increase risk-adjusted direct subsidies and cap members' out-of-pocket costs and as a result significantly impact seasonality and cost trends.

The Insurance segment also experiences seasonality in the commercial fully-insured product offering. The effect on the Insurance segment benefit ratio is opposite of the Medicare stand-alone PDP impact, with the benefit ratio increasing as fully-insured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business increased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by 10 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024 and did not impact the Insurance segment benefit ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Insurance segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the Medicare marketing season. The Insurance segment may experience adverse impacts in the operating cost ratio as a result of our Employer Group Commercial Medical Products exit. The Employer Group Commercial Fully-Insured business did not impact the Insurance segment operating cost ratio for the year-ended December 31, 2024 and increased the Insurance segment operating cost ratio by 30 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Highlights 

•Our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets. At the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused, provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. We believe this strategy is positioning us for long-term growth in both membership and earnings. We offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. These include performance bonuses, shared savings and shared risk relationships. At December 31, 2024, approximately 3,994,300 members, or 71%, of our individual Medicare Advantage members were in value-based relationships under our integrated care delivery model, as compared to 3,764,300 members, or 70%, at December 31, 2023. 

•Net income attributable to Humana was $1.2 billion, or $9.98 per diluted common share, and $2.5 billion, or $20.00 per diluted common share, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. This comparison was significantly impacted by put/call valuation adjustments associated with non-consolidating minority interest investments, charges associated with value creation initiatives, transaction and integration costs, impairment charges and an accrual related to certain anticipated litigation expenses. The impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for the 2024 and 2023 periods:

Regulatory Environment

We are and will continue to be regularly subject to new laws and regulations, changes to existing laws and regulations, and judicial determinations that impact the interpretation and applicability of those laws and regulations. The Health Care Reform Law, the Families First Act, the CARES Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, and related regulations, are examples of laws which have enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the U.S. health insurance industry, including, among others, mandated coverage requirements, mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with insurance products, rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios, adjustments to Medicare Advantage premiums, the establishment of federally facilitated or state-based exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers, and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values, and changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design.

It is reasonably possible that these laws and regulations, as well as other current or future legislative, judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network, manage and sell our products, or otherwise operate our business, or restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, further restrictions on service arrangements and fee payments between intercompany or vertically-integrated assets, increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses, or changes to the Part D prescription drug benefit design (and uncertainty arising from the implementation of these changes) in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations (including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments, restricting our ability to expand into new markets, increasing our medical and operating costs, further lowering our Medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments); our financial position (including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill); and our cash flows.

We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including the primary factors that accounted for those changes. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of products and services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers and are described in Note 18 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

* * *

Premiums Revenue

Consolidated premiums revenue increased $10.8 billion, or 10.7%, from $101.3 billion in the 2023 period to $112.1 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher per member Medicare premiums as well as Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth. These factors were partially offset by the continued decline in stand-alone PDP membership, as well as a decline in membership in our group commercial medical business as a result of our decision to exit the business.

Services Revenue

Consolidated services revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 9.9%, from $4.0 billion in the 2023 period to $4.4 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, partially offset by the impact of the v28 risk model revision.

Investment Income

Investment income increased $0.16 billion, or 14.7%, from $1.07 billion in the 2023 period to $1.23 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to an increase in interest income on our debt securities.

Benefits Expense

Consolidated benefits expense increased $12.3 billion, or 13.9%, from $88.4 billion in the 2023 period to $100.7 billion in the 2024 period. The consolidated benefit ratio increased 250 basis points from 87.3% in the 2023 period to 89.8% in the 2024 period primarily due to the continued impact of elevated Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts medical cost trends in the 2024 period as well as lower favorable prior period medical claims reserve development. These factors were partially offset by the impact of the pricing and benefit design of our 2024 Medicare Advantage products, which included a reduction in member benefits in response to the net impact of the 2024 final rate notice and the initial emergence of increased medical cost trends in 2023. Further, the year-over-year comparison continues to reflect a shift in line of business mix, with growth in Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts and other membership, which can carry a higher benefit ratio. 

Consolidated benefits expense included $701 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2024 period and $872 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2023 period. Prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 60 basis points in the 2024 period and decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the 2023 period.

Operating Costs

Our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs. We allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent.

Consolidated operating costs increased $0.5 billion, or 3.9%, from $13.2 billion in the 2023 period to $13.7 billion in the 2024 period. The consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 70 basis points from 12.5% in the 2023 period to 11.8% in the 2024 period. The ratio decrease was primarily due to scale efficiencies associated with growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership, administrative cost efficiencies resulting from our value creation initiatives, a lesser impact of commission expense for brokers in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period as a result of significant individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2023, a lesser impact from charges related to value creation initiatives in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period, as well as the impact of the accrued charge related to certain anticipated litigation expenses in the 2023 period. These factors were partially offset by significantly reduced compensation accruals in the 2023 period related to the annual incentive plan offered to employees across all levels of the company as our 2023 performance was negatively impacted by higher-than-anticipated Medicare Advantage utilization trends, as well as higher impairment costs in the 2024 period.

47

* * *

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased $60 million, or 7.7%, from $779 million in the 2023 period to $839 million in the 2024 period primarily due to capital expenditures.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $167 million, or 33.9%, from $493 million in the 2023 period to $660 million in the 2024 period primarily due to an increase in interest rates and higher average debt balances. 

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 25.5% and 25.2% for the 2024 period and 2023 period, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of current year earnings between our Insurance segment and our CenterWell health services segment, as our CenterWell health services segment is subject to a higher effective tax rate than our Insurance segment. For a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate, refer to Note 12 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Income from operations

Insurance segment income from operations decreased $1.4 billion, or 51.4%, from $2.6 billion in the 2023 period to $1.3 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to the same factors impacting the segment's higher benefit ratio partially offset by the impact of the lower operating cost ratio as more fully described below.

Enrollment

Individual Medicare Advantage membership increased 252,900 members, or 4.7%, from 5,408,900 members as of December 31, 2023 to 5,661,800 members as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to membership additions associated with the 2024 Annual Election Period, or AEP.  Individual Medicare Advantage membership includes 937,100 D-SNP members as of December 31, 2024, a net increase of 65,800 D-SNP members, or 7.6%, from 871,300 members as of December 31, 2023. For the full year 2025, we anticipate net membership decline in our individual Medicare Advantage offerings of approximately 550,000 members. 

Group Medicare Advantage membership increased 36,100 members, or 7.1%, from 509,600 members as of December 31, 2023 to 545,700 members as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to growth in small and medium group accounts. For the full year 2025, we anticipate net membership growth in our group Medicare Advantage offerings to be relatively flat.

Medicare stand-alone PDP membership decreased 560,900 members, or 19.7%, from 2,849,100 members as of December 31, 2023 to 2,288,200 members as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to continued intensified competition for Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings. For the full year 2025, we anticipate net membership growth in our Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings of approximately 200,000 members. 

State-based contracts and other membership increased 231,100 members, or 18.8%, from 1,228,800 members as of December 31, 2023 to 1,459,900 members as of December 31, 2024 reflecting the impact of membership additions associated with the implementation of new contracts partially offset with membership loss as a result of the public health of emergency unwind. For the full year 2025, we anticipate net membership growth in our state-based contracts of approximately 175,000 to 250,000 members.

Specialty membership decreased 306,300 members, or 6.3%, from 4,868,300 members as of December 31, 2023 to 4,562,000 members as of December 31, 2024 primarily due to non-renewal of dental and vision plans as a result of exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business. 

The decrease in commercial fully-insured and ASO membership as of December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is due to our exit of the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business.

Premiums revenue

Insurance segment premiums revenue increased $10.8 billion, or 10.7%, from $101.3 billion in the 2023 period to $112.1 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher per member Medicare premiums as well as Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts membership growth. These factors were partially offset by the continued decline in stand-alone PDP membership, as well as a decline in membership in our group commercial medical business as a result of our decision to exit the business.

Services revenue

Insurance segment services revenue decreased $34 million, or 3.4%, from $1.0 billion in the 2023 period to $966 million in the 2024 period.

Benefits expense

The Insurance segment benefit ratio increased 240 basis points from 88.0% in the 2023 period to 90.4% in the 2024 period primarily due to the continued impact of elevated Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts medical cost trends in the 2024 period as well as lower favorable prior period medical claims reserve development. These factors were partially offset by the impact of the pricing and benefit design of our 2024 Medicare Advantage products, which included a reduction in member benefits in response to the net impact of the 2024 final rate notice and the initial emergence of increased medical cost trends in 2023. Further, the year-over-year comparison continues to reflect a shift in line of business mix, with growth in Medicare Advantage and state-based contracts and other membership, which can carry a higher benefit ratio. 

50

* * *

The Insurance segment benefits expense included $701 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2024 period and $872 million of favorable prior-period medical claims reserve development in the 2023 period. Prior-period medical claims reserve development decreased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by approximately 60 basis points in the 2024 period and decreased the Insurance segment benefit ratio by approximately 90 basis points in the 2023 period.

Operating costs

The Insurance segment operating cost ratio decreased 100 basis points from 10.2% in the 2023 period to 9.2% in the 2024 period primarily due to scale efficiencies associated with growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership, administrative cost efficiencies resulting from our value creation initiatives, a lesser impact of commission expense for brokers in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period as a result of significant individual Medicare Advantage membership growth in 2023, as well as the impact of the accrued charge related to certain anticipated litigation expenses included in the 2023 period. These factors were partially offset by significantly reduced compensation accruals in the 2023 period.

Income from operations

CenterWell income from operations decreased $0.1 billion, or 5.3%, from $1.4 billion in the 2023 period to $1.3 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to the same factors impacting the segment's higher operating cost ratio as more fully described below.

Services revenue

CenterWell services revenue increased $0.4 billion, or 14.2%, from $3.0 billion in the 2023 period to $3.5 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, partially offset by the impact of the v28 risk model revision.

Intersegment revenues

CenterWell intersegment revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 7.1%, from $15.4 billion in the 2023 period to $16.5 billion in the 2024 period primarily due to greater intersegment revenues associated with the home solutions business in the 2024 period as compared to the 2023 period as a result of the expansion of services to Humana members under value-based contracts, an increase in pharmacy solutions revenues resulting from growth in the specialty pharmacy business, driven by increased penetration of Humana health plan members, as well as payor agnostic consumers, and higher revenues associated with growth in the primary care business, partially offset by the impact of the v28 risk model revision.

Operating costs

The CenterWell segment operating cost ratio increased 100 basis points from 91.2% in the 2023 period to 92.2% in the 2024 period primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the v28 risk model revision to the primary care business and the impact of significantly reduced compensation accruals in the 2023 period, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies resulting from our value creation initiatives and positive prior-period medical claims reserve development within the Primary Care Organization.

Liquidity

Historically, our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums, services revenue, and investment and other income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, and borrowings. Our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments, operating costs, interest on borrowings, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repayments on borrowings, dividends, and share repurchases. As premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment. From period to period, our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable, benefits payable, and other receivables and payables. Our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D subsidies for which we do not assume risk. The use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators) which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent. Our use of cash flows derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as in our CenterWell segment, is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators).

For additional information on our liquidity risk, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2024 from $4.7 billion at December 31, 2023. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is summarized as follows:

Cash Flow from Operating Activities

Cash flows provided by operations of $3.0 billion in the 2024 period decreased $1.0 billion from cash flows provided by operations of $4.0 billion in the 2023 period primarily due to lower earnings in the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period, partially offset by the favorable impact of working capital changes.

The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums. Benefits expense includes claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs net of rebates, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care and other supplemental benefits provided on or prior to the balance sheet date. For additional information regarding our benefits payable and benefits expense recognition, refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| | | | | | | |   
Change in receivables per cash flow statement| | | | | | | $| 669 | | $| 337 |   

The changes in Medicare receivables for both the 2024 period and the 2023 period reflect individual Medicare Advantage membership growth and the typical pattern caused by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the CMS risk-adjustment model. The increase in State-based contracts receivables for the 2024 and 2023 periods is primarily related to expansion to various states.

Cash Flow from Investing Activities

During the 2022 period, we completed the sale of a 60% interest of Gentiva Hospice to CD&R for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion, net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from Gentiva Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion. In connection with the sale we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $237 million which was reported as a gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

During the 2024, 2023 and 2022 periods, we acquired various businesses for approximately $89 million, $233 million and $337 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents received.

Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives, support of services in our primary care operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members, claims processing, billing and collections, wellness solutions, care coordination, regulatory compliance and customer service. Total net capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $568 million, $794 million and $1.1 billion in the 2024, 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively. 

Net purchases of investment securities were $2.2 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion in the 2024, 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

Our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. Claim payments were higher than receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk by $1.8 billion in the 2024 period and receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were higher than claim payments by $0.8 billion and $2 billion in the 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively. Our net receivable from CMS for subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was $0.5 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to a net payable of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023. 

Under our administrative services only TRICARE contract, health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by $92 million in the 2024 period and reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk by $57 million and $25 million in the 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively.

We also entered into an uncommitted receivables purchase facility under which certain pharmaceutical rebate receivables may be sold on a non-recourse basis to a financial institution. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the securities lending program and uncommitted receivables purchase facility provided net proceeds of $418 million and $123 million, respectively. 

In November 2024, we repaid our $500 million 5.700% unsecured senior notes due March 13, 2026.

Liquidity Requirements

We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, acquisitions, future expansion opportunities, and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months, as well as to refinance or repay debt, and repurchase shares.

Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2024 was BBB according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, or S&P, and Baa2 according to Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody’s. A downgrade by S&P to BB+ or by Moody’s to Ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to $250 million of our senior notes. Successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points, or annual interest expense by $1 million, up to a maximum 100 basis points, or annual interest expense by $3 million.

In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Humana Inc., our parent company, is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our state-regulated operating subsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the parent company were $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $0.5 billion at December 31, 2023. This increase primarily reflects working capital changes, net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper, proceeds from the sale and maturities of investment securities, dividends from insurance subsidiaries and cash from certain non-insurance subsidiaries within our CenterWell segment partially offset by common stock repurchases, repayment of maturing senior notes, repayment of borrowings under the commercial paper program, purchases of investment securities, capital expenditures, capital contributions to certain subsidiaries, cash dividends to shareholders and acquisitions. Our use of operating cash derived from our non-insurance subsidiaries, such as our CenterWell segment, is generally not restricted by departments of insurance (or comparable state regulators). Our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to our parent company of $1.5 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023, and $1.3 billion in 2022. Subsidiary capital requirements from significant premium growth may impact the amount of regulated subsidiary dividends. Refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in Schedule I - Parent Company Financial Information. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2025 is approximately $1.3 billion, in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix.

Regulatory Requirements

For a detailed discussion of our regulatory requirements, including aggregate statutory capital and surplus as well as dividends paid from the subsidiaries to our parent, please refer to Note 16 to the to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2024, we were not involved in any special purpose entity, or SPE, transactions. For a detailed discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, please refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, indefinite-lived and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and, accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Benefits Expense Recognition

Benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. For further discussion of our reserving methodology, including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate IBNR, refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2024 data:

The following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments.

(a)The factor change indicated represents the percentage point change.

As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $701 million in 2024, $872 million in 2023, and $415 million in 2022. 

The favorable medical claims reserve development for 2024, 2023, and 2022 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. 

59

* * *

Our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in Note 11 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

We continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves. Because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards, there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our December 31, 2024 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table. 

Revenue Recognition

We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions.

We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. We bill and collect premiums from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. Changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium. 

Premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. Premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Health Care Reform Law. We estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the Health Care Reform Law using a methodology prescribed by HHS, separately by state and legal entity. Medicare Advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the Health Care Reform Law. Estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. Premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.

Medicare Risk-Adjustment Provisions 

CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service (FFS) program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. For additional information, refer to Note 17 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

Investment Securities

Investment securities totaled $18.6 billion, or 40% of total assets at December 31, 2024, and $17.0 billion, or 36% of total assets at December 31, 2023. The investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities, detailed below, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of investment securities were as follows at December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Approximately 97% of our debt securities were investment-grade quality, with a weighted average credit rating of AA- by S&P at December 31, 2024. Most of the debt securities that were below investment-grade were rated B+, the higher end of the below investment-grade rating scale. Tax-exempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the United States as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education. Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the United States with no individual state exceeding approximately 1% of our total debt securities. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types.

Under the current expected credit losses model, or CECL, expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. For debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred. In the event of an expected credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder, if any, of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. To the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.

Potential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security; changes in the quality of the debt security's credit enhancement; payment structure of the debt security; changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies; failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. We estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.

We participate in a securities lending program to optimize investment income. We loan certain investment securities for short periods of time in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. The fair value of the loaned investment securities is monitored on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the fair value of the loaned investment securities fluctuates. The collateral, which may be in the form of cash or U.S. Government securities, is deposited by the borrower with an independent lending agent. Any cash collateral, which is reinvested by the lending agent primarily in short-term, highly liquid investments, is recorded as a securities lending collateral asset within other current assets on our 

62

* * *

consolidated balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. We record a corresponding liability to reflect our obligation to return the collateral within trade accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets because, absent default by the borrower, we do not have the right to sell, pledge or otherwise reinvest securities collateral. Loaned securities continue to be carried as investment securities on the consolidated balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. Earnings on the invested cash collateral, net of expense, associated with the securities lending payable are recorded as investment income.

The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations, facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time, or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is related to a credit event requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. There is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or expected credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods.

All issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2024 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased. At December 31, 2024, we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Additionally, we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Goodwill, Indefinite-lived and Long-lived Assets

At December 31, 2024, goodwill, indefinite-lived and other long-lived assets represented 29% of total assets and 83% of total stockholders’ equity, compared to 30% and 87%, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The decrease in goodwill, indefinite-lived and other long-lived assets as a percentage of total assets is primarily attributable to the increase in investment securities.

For goodwill, we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. 

We perform a quantitative assessment to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter, and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows. We rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value. However, outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We use discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to long-term growth prospects, consistent with the long-term inflation rate. Key assumptions in our cash flow projections, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical and operating cost trends, and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, including the impact of the Health Care Reform Law or changes in government reimbursement rates, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. The fair value of our reporting units with 

63

* * *

significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin. However, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our home solutions reporting unit, which accounted for $4.4 billion of goodwill. Impairment tests completed for 2024, 2023, and 2022 did not result in an impairment loss.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to Certificate of Needs (CON) and Medicare licenses acquired in connection with our CenterWell Home Health (formerly Kindred at Home) acquisition with a carrying value of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2024. Like goodwill, we are required to test at least annually for impairment and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. These tests are performed, at a minimum, annually in the fourth quarter. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on the income approach. For our CON intangible assets, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions, including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in the underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our CON intangible assets, which account for $910 million of our intangible assets. Impairment tests completed for 2024 and 2023 resulted in impairment charges of $200 million and $55 million, respectively. Impairment test completed for 2022 did not result in a material impairment charge. These charges reflect the amount by which the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. The fair values of the assets were measured using Level 3 inputs, such as projected revenues and operating cash flows. 

Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other definite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. Other than the impairment charges as described in Footnote 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K, there were no other impairment losses in the last three years.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk, including those resulting from changes in interest rates.

The level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. We have entered into interest-rate swap agreements with major financial institutions to convert our interest-rate exposure on some of our senior notes payable from fixed rates to variable rates, based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), to align interest costs more closely with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalents and investment securities Under the revolving credit agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either Term SOFR or the base rate plus a spread. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on Term SOFR, at our option. There were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreements at December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio, consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investment-grade quality with a weighted average S&P credit rating of AA- at December 31, 2024. Our net unrealized loss position increased $89 million from a net unrealized loss position of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023 to a net unrealized loss position of 

64

* * *

$1.4 billion at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, we had gross unrealized losses of $1.4 billion on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased. We did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position during 2024 and 2023. While we believe that these impairments will be recovered and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities, given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods.

Duration is the time-weighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our investment portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 3.8 years as of December 31, 2024 and 3.0 years as of December 31, 2023. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the December 31, 2024 fair value of our securities by approximately $783 million.

We have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200, and 300 basis points over the next twelve-month period, as reflected in the following table. The evaluation was based on our investment portfolio, outstanding indebtedness, and outstanding swap contract portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our investment portfolio consists of cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve-month period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income, including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio, changes in the asset allocation, including shifts between taxable and tax-exempt securities, spread changes specific to various investment categories and the mix of short-term versus long-term debt. In the past ten years, changes in 10 year US treasury rates during the year have not exceeded 300 basis points, have changed between 200 and 300 basis points one time, have changed between 100 and 200 basis points five times, and have changed by less than 100 basis points four times.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1\. REPORTING ENTITY

Nature of Operations

Humana Inc., headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is committed to putting health first – for our teammates, our customers, and our company. Through our Humana insurance services, and our CenterWell health care services, we make it easier for the millions of people we serve to achieve their best health – delivering the care and service they need, when they need it. These efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, Medicaid, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. References throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company,” and “Humana,” mean Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. We derived approximately 85% of our total premiums and services revenue from contracts with the federal government in 2024, including 14% related to our federal government contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to provide health insurance coverage for individual Medicare Advantage members in Florida. CMS is the federal government’s agency responsible for administering the Medicare program.

2\. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Humana Inc. and subsidiaries that the Company controls, including variable interest entities associated with medical practices for which we are the primary beneficiary. We do not own many of our medical practices but instead enter into exclusive management agreements with the affiliated Professional Associations, or P.A.s, that operate these medical practices. Based upon the provisions of these agreements, these affiliated P.A.s are variable interest entities and we are the primary beneficiary, and accordingly we consolidate the affiliated P.A.s. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The areas involving the most significant use of estimates are the estimation of benefits payable, the impact of risk adjustment provisions related to our Medicare contracts, the valuation and related impairment recognition of investment securities, and the valuation and related impairment recognition of long-lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates.

Employer Group Commercial Medical Products Business Exit

In February 2023, we announced our planned exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. No other Humana health plan offerings are materially affected. Following a strategic review, we determined the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support our long-term strategic plans. We anticipate the exit of this line of business to be finalized in the first half of 2025.

Value Creation Initiatives and Impairment Charges 

In order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our Medicare Advantage business and further expansion of our healthcare services capabilities beginning in 2022, we committed to drive additional value for the enterprise through cost saving, productivity initiatives, and value acceleration from previous investments. As a result of these initiatives, we recorded charges of $281 million, $436 million and $473 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily within operating costs in the consolidated statements of income.

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The value creation initiative charges primarily relate to $256 million, $237 million and $248 million in asset impairments in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as well as $25 million, $199 million and $116 million in severance charges in connection with workforce optimization in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remainder of the 2022 charges primarily relate to external consulting fees. 

In addition, we recorded impairment charges of $200 million, relating to indefinite-lived intangible assets, in 2024 and $91 million, including $55 million relating to indefinite-lived intangible assets, in 2023. There was no material impairment charge recorded in 2022. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were included within operating costs in our consolidated statements of income with the remaining impairment charges included within investment income. 

Further, we recorded severance charges of $70 million in 2023 within operating costs in our consolidated statement of income as a result of our exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business.

COVID-19

The emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business. Initially during periods of increased incidences of COVID-19, a reduction in non-COVID-19 hospital admissions for non-emergent and elective medical care resulted in lower overall healthcare system utilization. At the same time, COVID-19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization. During 2022, we experienced lower overall utilization of the healthcare system than anticipated, as the reduction in COVID-19 utilization following the increased incidence associated with the Omicron variant outpaced the increase in non-COVID-19 utilization. 

The COVID-19 National Emergency declared in 2020 was terminated on April 10, 2023 and the Public Health Emergency expired on May 11, 2023.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, other money market instruments, and certain U.S. Government securities with an original maturity of three months or less. Carrying value approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of the investments.

Investment Securities

Investment securities, which consist of debt securities, are stated at fair value. Our debt securities have been categorized as available for sale. Debt securities available for current operations, as well as our equity securities, are classified as current assets, and debt securities available to fund our professional and other self-insurance liability requirements, as well as restricted statutory deposits, are classified as long-term assets. For the purpose of determining realized gross gains and losses for debt securities sold, that are included as a component of investment income in the consolidated statements of income, the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification. Unrealized holding gains and losses for debt securities, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included in other comprehensive income or loss as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or an expected credit loss is recognized. For the purpose of determining gross gains and losses for equity securities, changes in fair value at the reporting date are included as a component of investment income in the consolidated statements of income.

Under the current expected credit losses model, or CECL, expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. For debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell, we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred. In the event of an expected credit loss, only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder, if any, of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income. To the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis, we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Potential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors, including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security; changes in the quality of the debt security's credit enhancement; payment structure of the debt security; changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies; failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds. For debt securities, we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data. For example, with respect to mortgage and asset-backed securities, such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements. We estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security. The present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase. The expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value.

We participate in a securities lending program to optimize investment income. We loan certain investment securities for short periods of time in exchange for collateral initially equal to at least 102% of the fair value of the investment securities on loan. The fair value of the loaned investment securities is monitored on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the fair value of the loaned investment securities fluctuates. The collateral, which may be in the form of cash or U.S. Government securities, is deposited by the borrower with an independent lending agent. Any cash collateral, which is reinvested by the lending agent primarily in short-term, highly liquid investments, is recorded as a securities lending collateral asset within other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. We record a corresponding liability to reflect our obligation to return the collateral within trade accounts payable and accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets because, absent default by the borrower, we do not have the right to sell, pledge or otherwise reinvest securities collateral. Loaned securities continue to be carried as investment securities on the consolidated balance sheet at the end of the reporting period. Earnings on the invested cash collateral, net of expense, associated with the securities lending payable are recorded as investment income.

Receivables and Revenue Recognition

We established one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions.

Premiums Revenue

We receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms. We bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our Medicare and other individual products monthly. Changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in risk-adjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and are recognized ratably during the year, with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium. Receivables or payables are classified as current or long-term in our consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of the expected settlement. 

Premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. Premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we collectively refer to as the Health Care Reform Law. We estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets, as defined by the Health Care Reform Law using a methodology prescribed by Health and Human Services, or HHS, separately by state and legal entity. Medicare Advantage and Medicaid products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements. Estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year

are revised each period to reflect current experience. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, estimated rebates, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. Premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.

Medicare Part D

We cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we receive monthly from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premiums revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract. Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. Receipts for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies and discounts on certain prescription drugs in the coverage gap represent payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk.

The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. As risk corridor provisions are considered in our overall annual bid process, we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to these provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or long-term in our consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of expected settlement.

Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent funding from CMS for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent funding from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMS’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. The Health Care Reform Law mandates consumer discounts of 75% on brand name and generic prescription drugs for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap. These discounts are funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers while we administer the application of these funds. 

We account for the funding of subsidies and discounts for which we assume no risk as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity under receipts (payments) from contract deposits, net in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

We do not recognize premiums revenue or benefit expenses for these subsidies or discounts. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period.

Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year. Settlement with CMS for brand name prescription drug discounts is based on a reconciliation made approximately 14 to 18 months after the close of each calendar year.

Patient services revenue 

Patient services include services related to pharmacy solutions, primary care, and home solutions and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health. 

For our pharmacy solutions business, external pharmacy revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments for drugs dispensed through our CenterWell Pharmacy (our mail-order pharmacy business), CenterWell Specialty Pharmacy, and retail pharmacies jointly located within CenterWell Senior Primary Care clinics. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Services revenues related to product revenues from dispensing prescriptions are recorded when the prescription or product is shipped.

Our primary care recognizes revenues for certain value-based arrangements. Under these value-based arrangements, we enter into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control the administration and management of certain health care services for our patients. In exchange, we receive a premium that is typically paid on a per-member per-month basis. These value-based arrangements represent a single performance obligation where revenues are recognized in the period in which we are obligated to provide integrated health care services to our patients. Fee-for-service revenue is recognized at agreed upon rates, net of contractual allowances, as the performance obligation is completed on the date of service.

For our home solutions businesses, revenues include net patient services revenue recorded based upon established billing rates, net of contractual allowances, discounts, or other implicit price concessions, and are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied, which is in the period services are rendered.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price), was not material. Further, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations is not material.

Administrative services fees 

Administrative services fees cover the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded groups. Revenues from providing administration services, also known as administrative services only, or ASO, are recognized in the period services are performed and are net of estimated uncollectible amounts. ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, many ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. Accordingly, we have recorded premiums revenue and benefits expense related to these stop loss insurance contracts. We routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in current operations. ASO fees received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues.

Under our TRICARE contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD) we provide administrative services, including offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, claim processing, customer service, enrollment, and other services, while the federal government retains all of the risk of the cost of health benefits. We account for revenues under our contracts net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement. Our contracts include fixed administrative services fees and incentive fees and penalties. Administrative services fees are recognized as services are performed. 

76

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Our TRICARE members are served by both in-network and out-of-network providers in accordance with our contracts. We pay health care costs related to these services to the providers and are subsequently reimbursed by the DoD for such payments. We account for the payments of the federal government’s claims and the related reimbursements under deposit accounting in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity under receipts (payments) from contract deposits, net in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Receivables

Receivables, including premium receivables, patient services revenue receivables, and ASO fee receivables, are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, retroactive membership adjustments, and contractual allowances.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivable related to services were $360 million and $357 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Other Current Assets

Other current assets include amounts associated with Medicare Part D, rebates due from pharmaceutical manufacturers and other amounts due within one year. We accrue pharmaceutical rebates as they are earned based on contractual terms and usage of the product. The balance of pharmaceutical rebates receivable was $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

In October 2024, we entered an uncommitted receivables purchase facility, or the Facility, under which certain pharmaceutical rebate receivables may be sold on a non-recourse basis to a financial institution. Although the sale is made without recourse, we provide collection services related to the transferred assets without compensation. The Facility's total capacity is $1.19 billion with an initial one year term, unless terminated early or extended. As control of, and risk related to, the receivables are transferred to the financial institution, the transactions under the Facility are accounted for as a true sale. The derecognition of our receivables transferred to a financial institution reduce our net pharmaceutical rebate receivable balance included in “Other current assets” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and generate a loss on discounted receivables included in “Operating costs” on our accompanying consolidated statements of income. As servicer of the purchased receivables, we establish a payable to the financial institution included in “Trade accounts payable and accrued expenses” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for rebates collected from manufacturers not yet remitted to the financial institution. Cash proceeds from the sale of receivables to the financial institution are classified as an operating activity included in “Changes in other assets” and rebates collected from manufacturers not yet remitted to the financial institution are classified as a financing activity included in “Changes in rebate factor payable” on our accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold $639 million of pharmaceutical rebate receivables under the Facility and the loss on discounted receivables were not material. As of December 31, 2024, we collected $168 million from manufacturers, $123 million of which have not been remitted to the financial institution.

Policy Acquisition Costs

Policy acquisition costs are those costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies. Such costs include commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and other costs we incur to acquire new business or renew existing business. We expensed policy acquisition costs related to our 

77

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

employer-group prepaid health services policies as incurred. These short-duration employer-group prepaid health services policies typically have a 1-year term and may be canceled upon 30 days notice by the employer group.

Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment is recorded at cost. Gains and losses on sales or disposals of property and equipment are included in operating costs in our consolidated income statements. Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years for equipment, 3 to 5 years for computer software, and 10 to 20 years for buildings. Improvements to leased facilities are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the anticipated life of the improvement.

We periodically review long-lived assets, including property and equipment and other definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Losses are recognized for a long-lived asset to be held and used in our operations when the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than its carrying value. We recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. A long-lived asset held for sale is reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation expense is not recognized on assets held for sale. Losses are recognized for a long-lived asset to be abandoned when the asset ceases to be used. In addition, we periodically review the estimated lives of all long-lived assets for reasonableness.

Equity Method Investments

We use the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies where we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, organizational structure, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.

Generally, under the equity method, original investments in these entities are recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted by our share of equity in income or losses after the date of acquisition as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net income. Investment amounts in excess of our share of an investee’s net assets are amortized over the life of the related asset creating the excess. Excess goodwill is not amortized. 

We evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by us when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than carrying value, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

For additional information regarding our equity method investments, refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Form 10-K.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the unamortized excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. We are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit, and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments, referred to as a component, which comprise our reportable segments. A component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management. We aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar 

78

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

economic characteristics. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the specific synergies of the business combination.

We perform a quantitative assessment to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Impairment tests are performed, at a minimum, in the fourth quarter of each year supported by our long-range business plan and annual planning process. We rely on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows to determine fair value of our reporting units. The fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts. However, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our home solutions reporting unit, which accounted for $4.4 billion of goodwill. Impairment tests completed for 2024, 2023, and 2022 did not result in an impairment loss. 

Intangible assets with indefinite lives relate to Certificate of Needs (CON) and Medicare licenses acquired as part of our acquisition of CenterWell Home Health (formerly Kindred at Home) are included within other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We are required to annually compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on the income approach. For our CON intangible assets, unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions, including a significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate or substantial reduction in the underlying cash flow assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating cost trends, and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our CON intangible assets, which account for $910 million of our intangible assets. Impairment tests completed for 2024 and 2023 resulted in impairment charges of $200 million and $55 million, respectively. Impairment test completed for 2022 did not result in a material impairment charge. These charges reflect the amount by which the carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value. The fair values of the assets were measured using Level 3 inputs, such as projected revenues and operating cash flows. 

Definite-lived intangible assets primarily relate to acquired customer contracts/relationships and are included with other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life generally using the straight-line method. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under our long-lived asset policy.

Benefits Payable and Benefits Expense Recognition

Benefits expense includes claim payments, capitation payments, pharmacy costs net of rebates, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care and other supplemental benefits provided on or prior to the balance sheet date. Capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members. Pharmacy costs represent payments for members’ prescription drug benefits, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. Receivables for such pharmacy rebates are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Other supplemental benefits include dental, vision, and other supplemental health products.

We estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors, and record benefit reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves.

Benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. Our reserving practice is to consistently 

79

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.

We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent two months, a completion factor method uses historical paid claims patterns to estimate the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. Changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes are taken into account in these estimates. For the most recent two months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of hospital admissions, recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, changes in medical management processes, product mix, and workday seasonality.

The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent two months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent two months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Changes in claim processes, including recoveries of overpayments, receipt cycle times, claim inventory levels, outsourcing, system conversions, and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors. Claim payments to providers for services rendered are often net of overpayment recoveries for claims paid previously, as contractually allowed. Claim overpayment recoveries can result from many different factors, including retroactive enrollment activity, audits of provider billings, and/or payment errors. Changes in patterns of claim overpayment recoveries can be unpredictable and result in completion factor volatility, as they often impact older dates of service. The receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received. Increases in electronic claim submissions from providers decrease the receipt cycle time. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claim may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using our completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required.

Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, new higher priced technologies and medical procedures, and new prescription drugs and therapies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, the tort liability system, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, lifestyle changes including diet and smoking, catastrophes, public health emergencies, epidemics and pandemics (such as COVID-19) also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent two months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent two months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management.

We reassess the profitability of our contracts for providing insurance coverage to our members when current operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses. We establish a premium deficiency reserve in current 

80

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

operations to the extent that the sum of expected future costs, claim adjustment expenses, and maintenance costs exceeds related future premiums under contracts. For purposes of determining premium deficiencies, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Losses recognized as a premium deficiency result in a beneficial effect in subsequent periods as operating losses under these contracts are charged to the liability previously established. Because the majority of our member contracts renew annually, we would not record a material premium deficiency reserve, except when unanticipated adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate otherwise.

We believe our benefits payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required. However, such estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events. Therefore, the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts provided.

Future policy benefits payable

Future policy benefits payable includes liabilities for long-duration insurance policies primarily related to certain blocks of insurance assumed in acquisitions, primarily life and annuities in run-off status, and are included in our consolidated balance sheet within other long-term liabilities. Most of these policies are subject to reinsurance. For additional information regarding reinsurance, refer to Note 19 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Form 10-K.

Book Overdraft

Under our cash management system, checks issued but not yet presented to banks that would result in negative bank balances when presented are classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in book overdrafts from period to period are reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity.

Income Taxes

We recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. These temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. We also recognize the future tax benefits such as net operating and capital loss carryforwards as deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided against these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future years’ tax expense may be increased or decreased by adjustments to the valuation allowance or to the estimated accrual for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are further adjusted for changes in the enacted tax rates. 

We record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax return position taken with respect to a particular transaction will be sustained. A liability, if recorded, is not considered resolved until the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired, or the tax position is ultimately settled through examination, negotiation, or litigation. We classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes.

Noncontrolling Interests

The consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned affiliates that we control. Accordingly, we record noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such entities. We record adjustments to noncontrolling interests for the allocable portion of income or loss to which the noncontrolling interest holders are entitled based upon their portion of the subsidiaries they own. Distributions to holders of noncontrolling interests are adjusted to the respective noncontrolling interest holders’ balances. Noncontrolling interests, which relate to the minority ownership held by third-party investors in certain of our businesses within our Insurance and CenterWell segments, are reported below net income under the heading “Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the consolidated statements of income and presented as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

Stock-Based Compensation

We generally recognize stock-based compensation expense, as determined on the date of grant at fair value, on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). In addition, for awards with both time and performance-based conditions, we generally recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. We estimate expected forfeitures and recognize compensation expense only for those awards which are expected to vest. We estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

For additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans, refer to Note 14 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Form 10-K.

Earnings Per Common Share

We compute basic earnings per common share on the basis of the weighted-average number of unrestricted common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of unrestricted common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding employee stock options and restricted shares, or units, using the treasury stock method.

For additional information regarding our earnings per share, refer to Note 15 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Form 10-K.

Fair Value

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized into a fair value hierarchy based on whether the inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use. The fair value hierarchy includes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as described below.

Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include securities that are traded in an active exchange market.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments as well as debt securities whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 includes assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use as well as those requiring significant management judgment.

Fair value of actively traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Fair value of other debt securities are based on quoted market prices of identical or similar securities or based on observable inputs like interest rates generally using a market valuation approach, or, less frequently, an income valuation approach and are generally classified as Level 2. Fair value of privately held investment grade debt securities are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both market and income approaches, where an observable quoted market does not exist and are generally classified as Level 3. For privately-held investment grade debt securities,

such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business with similar credit characteristics, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows.

We obtain at least one price for each security from a third-party pricing service. These prices are generally derived from recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, including adjustments through the reporting date based upon observable market information. When quoted prices are not available, the third-party pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable securities or discounted cash flow analysis, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include benchmark yields, reported trades, credit spreads, broker quotes, default rates, and prepayment speeds. We are responsible for the determination of fair value and as such we perform analysis on the prices received from the third-party pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes a review of monthly price fluctuations as well as a quarterly comparison of the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by our third-party investment adviser. In addition, on a quarterly basis we examine the underlying inputs and assumptions for a sample of individual securities across asset classes, credit rating levels, and various durations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting — Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the method for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. The new guidance became effective for us beginning with our annual 2024 year-end financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 in 2024 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our segment footnote disclosure was updated to reflect adoption of the standard. 

Accounting Pronouncements Effective in Future Periods

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 — Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The new guidance requires significant additional disclosures about income taxes, primarily focused on the disclosure of income taxes paid and the rate reconciliation table. The new guidance requires prospective application (with retrospective application permitted). The new guidance will be effective for us beginning with our annual 2025 year-end financial statements, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our income tax footnote disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03 — Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The new guidance requires significant additional disclosures disaggregating certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization.

3\. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

On August 11, 2022, we completed the sale of a 60% interest in Gentiva (formerly Kindred) Hospice to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, or CD&R, for cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion, net of cash disposed, including debt repayments from Gentiva Hospice to Humana of $1.9 billion. In connection with the sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $237 million which was reported as a gain on sale of Gentiva Hospice in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Prior to the sale, Gentiva Hospice revenues and pretax earnings through the date of sale for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $958 million and $150 million, respectively. 

During 2024, 2023, and 2022, we acquired various health and wellness related businesses which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The results of operations and financial condition of these businesses acquired have been included in our consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets from the respective acquisition dates. Acquisition-related costs recognized in each of 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material to our results of operations. For asset acquisitions, the goodwill acquired is partially amortizable as deductible expenses for tax purposes. The pro forma financial information assuming the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of the calendar year prior to the year of acquisition, as well as the revenues and earnings generated during the year of acquisition, were not material for disclosure purposes.

In 2020, our Primary Care Organization entered into a strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, to accelerate the expansion of our primary care model. In May 2022, we established a second strategic partnership with WCAS to develop additional centers between 2023 and 2025. As of December 31, 2024, there were 133 primary care clinics operating under the partnership and we have capacity to open or acquire up to approximately 20 additional centers through the existing partnership agreements. In addition, the agreements include a series of put and call options through which WCAS may require us to purchase their interest in the entity, and through which we may acquire WCAS’s interest, over the next 1 to 9 years. We have the option to purchase the first cohort of clinics in 2025 for approximately $600 million to $700 million based on current projections. All existing cohorts can be called by us from 2025 to 2032 and could require $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion based on current projections. These estimates are dependent on multiple factors including the actual timing of when the put or call options are exercised, expected revenue growth at each center within the respective cohort and future capital contributions, among other factors. For additional information on inputs relevant to these put and call options, refer to Note 6 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.

Other equity method investments

We have several other individually immaterial equity method investments included within equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 with our share of income or loss reported as equity in net losses in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the United States as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities, water and sewer, transportation, or education. Our general obligation bonds are diversified across the United States with no individual state exceeding approximately 1% of our total debt securities. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. 

Our unrealized losses from all debt securities were generated from approximately 1,780 positions out of a total of approximately 2,200 positions at December 31, 2024. All issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at December 31, 2024 remain current on all contractual payments. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased. At December 31, 2024, we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income, and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Additionally, we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Interest Rate Swaps

We have entered into interest-rate swap agreements with major financial institutions to convert our interest-rate exposure on some of our senior notes payable from fixed rates to variable rates, based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), to align interest costs more closely with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalents and investment securities. These swap agreements were qualified and designated as a fair value hedge. Our interest rate swaps are recognized in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value as of the reporting date. Our interest rate swaps are highly effective at reflecting the fair value of our hedged fixed rate senior notes payable. We utilize market-based financing rates, forward yield curves and discount rates in determining fair value of these swaps at each reporting date, a Level 2 measure within the fair value hierarchy. The cumulative, aggregate adjustment to the carrying value of the senior notes was a decrease of approximately $129 million at December 31, 2024. The swap liability, included within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, was approximately $129 million at December 31, 2024. The swap asset, included within other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet, was approximately $68 million at December 31, 2023. We include the gain or loss on the swap agreements in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income, the same line item as the offsetting loss or gain on the related senior notes. The gain or loss due to hedge ineffectiveness was not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Financial Liabilities

Our debt is recorded at carrying value in our consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of our senior notes debt outstanding, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $11.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The fair value of our senior note debt was $11.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The fair value of our senior note debt is determined based on Level 2 inputs, including quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or if no quoted market prices are available, on the current prices estimated to be available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. Carrying value approximates fair value for our term loans and commercial paper borrowings. We had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2024. The commercial paper borrowings were $0.9 billion at December 31, 2023.

Put and Call Options Measured at Fair Value

The put and call options fair values associated with our Primary Care Organization strategic partnership with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, or WCAS, which are exercisable at a fixed revenue exit multiple and provide a minimum return on WCAS' investment if exercised, are measured at fair value each reporting period using a Monte Carlo simulation. The put and call options fair values, derived from the Monte Carlo simulation, were $883 million and $10 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The put and call options fair values, derived from the Monte Carlo simulation, were $595 million and $18 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The put liability and call asset are included within other long-term liabilities and other long-term assets, respectively, within our consolidated balance sheets. 

The significant unobservable inputs utilized in these Level 3 fair value measurements (and selected values) include the enterprise value, annualized volatility and credit spread. Enterprise value was derived from a discounted cash flow model, which utilized significant unobservable inputs for long-term revenue, to measure underlying cash flows, weighted average cost of capital and long term growth rate. The table below presents the assumptions used for December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively: 

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| December 31, 2024| December 31, 2023| | |   
Annualized volatility| 17.5% - 18.9%| 16.1% to 17.8%| | |   
Credit spread| 0.9% - 1.5%| 0.9% to 1.1%| | |

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The assumptions used for annualized volatility, credit spread and weighted average cost of capital reflect the lowest and highest values where they differ significantly across the series of put and call options due to their expected exercise dates.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis subject to fair value adjustment only in certain circumstances. As disclosed in Note 3, we completed the sale of a 60% interest in Gentiva Hospice on August 11, 2022. The carrying value of the assets and liabilities of Gentiva Hospice disposed approximates fair value. The amount of goodwill included in the carrying value is based on the relative fair value of Gentiva Hospice as compared to the total fair value of our home solutions reporting unit included within the CenterWell segment.

Additionally, as disclosed in Note 3, we completed our acquisitions of certain health and wellness related businesses during 2024, 2023, and 2022. The values of net tangible assets acquired and the resulting goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded at fair value using Level 3 inputs. The majority of the related tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as of the respective dates of acquisition, as their carrying values approximated their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in these acquisitions were internally estimated primarily based on the income approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on the present value of the cash flows that the assets are expected to generate in the future. We developed internal estimates for the expected cash flows and discount rates in the present value calculations. Other than assets acquired and liabilities assumed in these acquisitions, there were no material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during 2024, 2023, or 2022.

7\. MEDICARE PART D

We cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets include the following amounts associated with Medicare Part D as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. CMS subsidies/discounts in the table below include the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies funded by CMS for which we assume no risk as well as brand name prescription drug discounts for Part D plan participants in the coverage gap funded by CMS and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

10\. LEASES

We determine if a contract contains a lease by evaluating the nature and substance of the agreement. We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other furniture and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For new lease agreements, we combine lease and nonlease components for all of our asset classes.

When portions of the lease payments are not fixed or depend on an index or rate, we consider those payments to be variable in nature. Our variable lease payments include, but are not limited to, common area maintenance, taxes and insurance which are not dependent upon an index or rate. Variable lease payments are recorded in the period in which the obligation for the payment is incurred. Most leases include options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Right-of-use assets included within other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $445 million and $510 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Operating lease liabilities included within trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets were $130 million and $149 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, operating lease liabilities included within other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $392 million and $444 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The classification of our operating lease liabilities is based on the remaining lease term.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total fixed operating lease costs, excluding short-term lease costs, were $121 million, $145 million and $183 million, respectively, and are included within operating costs in our consolidated statements of income. Short-term lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, total variable operating lease costs were $127 million, $120 million and $101 million, respectively, and are included within operating costs in our consolidated statements of income. 

We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third-party tenants for space not used in our operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, sublease rental income was $50 million, $66 million and $52 million, respectively, and is included within operating costs in our consolidated statements of income.

The weighted average remaining lease term is 5.1 years and 5.4 years at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted average discount rate is 4.6% and 3.9% at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities included within our operating cash flows was $143 million, $166 million and $191 million, respectively.

The total estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, is included within the net 

incurred claims amounts. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, benefits payable included IBNR of approximately $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion, primarily associated with claims incurred in each respective year. The cumulative number of reported claims as of December 31, 2024 was approximately 224.4 million for claims incurred in 2024, 211.4 million for claims incurred in 2023, and 182.8 million for claims incurred in 2022.

Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. We experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of $701 million in 2024, $872 million in 2023, and $415 million in 2022.

The medical claims reserve development for 2024, 2023, and 2022 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. The favorable development recognized in 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from trend factors developing more favorably than originally expected. The favorable development recognized in 2022 resulted primarily from trend factors developing more favorably than originally expected with completion factors remaining largely unchanged, resulting in lower overall development as compared to 2024 and 2023.

Incurred and Paid Claims Development

The following discussion provides information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2024, net of reinsurance, as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of IBNR included within the net incurred claims amounts. The information about incurred and paid claims development for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is presented as supplementary information.

Claims frequency is measured as medical fee-for-service claims for each service encounter with a unique provider identification number. Our claims frequency measure includes claims covered by deductibles as well as claims under capitated arrangements. Claim counts may vary based on product mix and the percentage of delegated capitation arrangements.

Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:| | |   
| | |   
Other long-term assets| $| 260 | | | $| 48 |   

All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets as other long-term assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $16 million of federal net operating losses and approximately $1.1 billion of pre-apportioned state and Puerto Rico net operating losses to carry forward. A portion of these loss carryforwards, if not used to offset future taxable income, will expire from 2025 through 2042. The balance of the net operating loss carryforwards has no expiration date. Due to limitations and uncertainty regarding our ability to use some of the loss carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of $85 million was established. For the remainder of the net operating loss carryforwards and other cumulative temporary differences, based on our historical record of producing taxable income and profitability, we have concluded that future operating income will be sufficient to recover these deferred tax assets. 

We file income tax returns in the United States and Puerto Rico. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, has completed its examinations of our consolidated income tax returns for 2022 and prior years. Our 2023 tax return is in the post-filing review period under the Compliance Assurance Process, or CAP. Our 2024 tax return is under advance review by the IRS under CAP. With a few exceptions, which are immaterial in the aggregate, we are no longer subject to state, local and foreign tax examinations for years before 2021. We are not aware of any material adjustments that may be proposed as a result of any ongoing or future examinations. We do not have material uncertain tax positions reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.

Senior Notes

Our senior notes, which are unsecured, may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified make-whole amount. The 8.150% senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded (or subsequently upgraded). In addition, our senior notes contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances. 

We repaid the remaining $559 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.850% senior notes on their maturity date of October 1, 2024. In November 2024, we repaid our $500 million 5.700% unsecured senior notes due March 13, 2026.

In March 2024, we issued $1.3 billion of 5.375% unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2031 and $1.0 billion of 5.750% unsecured senior notes due April 15, 2054. Our net proceeds, reduced for the underwriters' discounts and commissions paid, were $2.2 billion. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of existing indebtedness, including borrowings under our commercial paper program.

We have entered into interest-rate swap agreements with major financial institutions to convert our interest-rate exposure on some of our senior notes payable from fixed rates to variable rates, based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), to align interest costs more closely with floating interest rates received on our cash equivalents and investment securities, as further described in Note 6. As a result, the carrying value of these senior notes has been adjusted to reflect changes in value caused by an increase or decrease in interest rates. The cumulative, aggregate adjustment to the carrying value of the senior notes was a decrease of approximately $129 million at December 31, 2024. 

Revolving Credit Agreements

In June 2023, we entered into an amended and restated 5-year, $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (replacing the 5-year, $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement entered in June 2021). In May 2024, we entered into an amendment to increase commitments under the 5-year revolving credit agreement by $0.142 billion resulting in a $2.642 billion borrowing capacity. 

In May 2024, we entered into a 364-day $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (replacing the 364-day $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement entered in June 2023, which expired in accordance with its terms). 

Under the credit agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at Term SOFR or the base rate plus a spread. The 

100

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based Term SOFR, at our option. 

The SOFR spread, currently 114 basis points under the 5-year revolving credit agreement and 116 basis points under the 364-day revolving credit agreement, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 92.0 to 130.0 basis points under the 5-year revolving credit agreement and from 94.0 to 135.0 basis points under the 364-day revolving credit agreement. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 11.0 basis points, under the 5-year revolving credit agreement and 9.0 basis points under the 364-day revolving agreement, varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 8.0 to 20.0 basis points under the 5-year revolving credit agreement and from 6.0 to 15.0 basis points under the 364-day revolving credit agreement.

The terms of our revolving credit agreements include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, our credit agreements contain customary restrictive covenants and a financial covenant regarding maximum debt to capitalization of 60%, as well as customary events of default. We are in compliance with this financial covenant, with actual debt to capitalization of 41.9% as measured in accordance with the revolving credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. Upon our agreement with one or more financial institutions, we may expand the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit agreements by up to $500 million, to a maximum of $5.25 billion, across the 5-year and 364-day revolving credit agreements. 

At December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings and approximately $18 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit agreements. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2024, we had $2.624 billion of remaining borrowing capacity under the 5-year revolving credit agreement and $2.1 billion of remaining borrowing capacity under the 364-day revolving credit agreement (which excludes the uncommitted $500 million of incremental loan facilities), none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement. 

We have other customary relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the revolving credit agreements.

Commercial Paper

Under our commercial paper program we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discount basis through certain broker dealers at any time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $2.7 billion, with none outstanding at December 31, 2024 compared to $871 million outstanding at December 31, 2023. 

Other Short-Term Borrowings

We are a member, through one subsidiary, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, or FHLB. As a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. In 2023, we received a short-term cash advance of $100 million from FHLB with certain of our marketable securities as collateral and subsequently repaid the outstanding balance in December 2023. At December 31, 2024 we had no outstanding short-term FHLB borrowings.

14\. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employee Savings Plan

We have defined contribution retirement savings plans covering eligible associates which include matching contributions based on the amount of our associates’ contributions to the plans. The cost of these plans amounted to approximately $293 million in 2024, $278 million in 2023, and $286 million in 2022. The Company’s cash match is invested pursuant to the participant’s contribution direction. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $253.71 on December 31, 2024, approximately 4% of the retirement and savings plan’s assets were invested in our 

101

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

common stock, or approximately 1.1 million shares, representing approximately 0.9% of the shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our defined contribution retirement savings plans.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have plans under which options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock units have been granted to executive officers, directors and key associates. Awards generally require both a change in control and termination of employment within 2 years of the date of the change in control to accelerate the vesting, including those granted to retirement-eligible participants. 

The terms and vesting schedules for stock-based awards vary by type of grant. Generally, the awards vest upon time-based conditions. We have also granted awards to certain associates that vest upon a combination of time and performance-based conditions. The stock awards of retirement-eligible participants are generally earned ratably over the service period for each tranche. Accordingly, upon retirement the earned portion of the current tranche will continue to vest on the originally scheduled vest date and any remaining unearned portion of the award will be forfeited. Our equity award program includes a retirement provision that generally treats associates with a combination of age and years of services with the Company totaling 65 or greater, with a minimum required age of 55 and a minimum requirement of 5 years of service, as retirement-eligible. Upon exercise, stock-based compensation awards are settled with authorized but unissued company stock or treasury stock. 

The compensation expense that has been charged against income for these plans was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Tax benefit recognized| (29)| | | (28)| | | (28)|   
Stock-based compensation expense, net of tax| $| 178 | | | $| 147 | | | $| 188 |   

The tax benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is based on the amount of compensation expense recorded for book purposes, subject to limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of $500,000 per employee as mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. The actual tax benefit realized in our tax return is based on the intrinsic value, or the excess of the market value over the exercise or purchase price, of stock options exercised and restricted stock vested during the period, subject to limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of $500,000 per employee as mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. The actual tax benefit realized for the deductions taken on our tax returns from option exercises and restricted stock vesting totaled $21 million in 2024, $30 million in 2023, and $31 million in 2022. There was no capitalized stock-based compensation expense during these years.

At December 31, 2024, there were approximately 11.0 million shares reserved for stock award plans under the Humana Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2011 Plan, and approximately 14.3 million shares reserved for stock award plans under the Humana Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2019 Plan. These reserved shares included giving effect to, under the 2011 Plan, 3.3 million shares of common stock available for future grants assuming all stock options were granted or 1.4 million shares available for future grants assuming all restricted stock were granted. These reserved shares included giving effect to, under the 2019 Plan, 7.5 million shares of common stock available for future grants assuming all stock options were granted or 2.2 million shares available for future grants assuming all restricted stock were granted. Shares may be issued from authorized but unissued company stock or treasury stock.

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock is granted with a fair value equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant and generally vests in equal annual tranches over a three year period from the date of grant. Certain of our restricted stock grants also include performance-based conditions generally associated with return on invested capital and strategic membership growth. Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. The weighted-average grant date fair value of our restricted stock was $364.59 in 2024, $508.23 in 2023, and $430.06 in 2022. Activity for our restricted stock was as follows for the year ended December 31, 2024:

Forfeited| (75)| | | 433.72 |   
Nonvested restricted stock at December 31, 2024| 868 | | | $| 426.40 |   

Approximately 33% of the nonvested restricted stock at December 31, 2024 included performance-based conditions.

The fair value of shares vested was $157 million during 2024, $236 million during 2023, and $244 million during 2022. Total compensation expense not yet recognized related to nonvested restricted stock was $221 million at December 31, 2024. We expect to recognize this compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years. There are no other contractual terms covering restricted stock once vested.

Stock Options

Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Our stock plans, as approved by the Board of Directors and stockholders, define fair market value as the average of the highest and lowest stock prices reported on the composite tape by the New York Stock Exchange on a given date. Exercise provisions vary, but most options vest in whole or in part 1 to 3 years after grant and expire 7 years after grant.

The weighted-average fair value of each option granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022 is provided below. The fair value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the weighted-average assumptions indicated below:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2024| | 2023| | 2022

Risk-free interest rate at grant date| 4.3 | %| | 4.5 | %| | 1.8 | %  
Dividend yield| 0.9 | %| | 0.7 | %| | 0.7 | %  

We calculate the expected term for our employee stock options based on historical employee exercise behavior and base the risk-free interest rate on a traded zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term substantially equal to the option’s expected term.

Options exercisable at December 31, 2024| 166 | | | $| 393.73 |   

As of December 31, 2024, outstanding stock options, substantially all of which are expected to vest, had no intrinsic value, and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 4.5 years. As of December 31, 2024, exercisable stock options had no intrinsic value, and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.1 years. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2024 was $0.1 million, compared with $3 million during 2023 and $32 million during 2022. Cash received from stock option exercises totaled $0.3 million in 2024, $9 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022.

Total compensation expense not yet recognized related to nonvested options was $14 million at December 31, 2024. We expect to recognize this compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years.

Dividends

The following table provides details of dividend payments, excluding dividend equivalent rights, in 2022, 2023, and 2024, under our Board approved quarterly cash dividend policy:

In October 2024, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.885 per share payable on January 31, 2025 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2024 for an aggregate amount of $107 million. In February 2025, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.885 per share payable on April 25, 2025 to stockholders of record on March 28, 2025. Declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our Board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.

Stock Repurchases

Our Board of Directors may authorize the purchase of our common shares. Under our share repurchase authorization, shares may have been purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchases, through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or in privately-negotiated transactions (including pursuant to accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks), subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume, pricing, and timing. 

Effective February 16, 2024, the Board of Directors replaced the February 2023 repurchase authorization (of which approximately $824 million remained unused) with a new share repurchase authorization for repurchases of up to $3 billion of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans, expiring as of February 15, 2027, which we refer to as the 2024 repurchase authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million common shares in open market transactions under the 2024 repurchase authorization for $74 million at an average price of $339.55 and approximately 1.7 million common shares in open market transactions under the February 2023 repurchase authorization for $676 million at an average price of $390.30.

Our remaining repurchase authorization was $2.9 billion as of February 19, 2025.

Excluding shares acquired in connection with employee stock plans, share repurchases were as follows during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Regulatory Requirements

Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, or ordinary dividends, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend requiring prior regulatory approval. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 

Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements vary significantly at the state level. Our state regulated insurance subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $13.2 billion and $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements of  $11.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2025 is approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate. The amount, timing and mix of ordinary and extraordinary dividend payments will vary due to state regulatory requirements, the level of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. Actual dividends that were paid to our parent company were approximately $1.5 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023, and $1.3 billion in 2022.

17\. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES

Purchase Obligations

We have agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. We have purchase obligation commitments of $647 million in 2025, $469 million in 2026, $342 million in 2027, $234 million in 2028, and $205 million in 2029. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, or SPEs, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2024, we were not involved in any SPE transactions.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of certain of our non-regulated subsidiaries and funding to maintain required statutory capital levels of certain regulated subsidiaries.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third-party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Government Contracts

Our Medicare products, which accounted for approximately 85% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare products have been renewed for 2025, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2025 have been approved.

CMS uses a risk-adjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans according to health status of covered members. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more where a plan's membership has higher expected costs. Under this model, rates paid to MA plans are based on actuarially determined bids, which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard Medicare-covered benefits to an enrollee with a "national average risk profile." That baseline payment amount is adjusted to account for certain demographic characteristics and health status of our enrolled members. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all MA plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The CMS risk-adjustment model uses the diagnosis data, collected from providers, to calculate the health status-related risk-adjusted premium payment to MA plans, which CMS further adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government fee-for-service (FFS) program. We generally rely on providers, including certain providers in our network who are our employees, to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses, which we send to CMS as the basis for our health status-adjusted payment received from CMS under the actuarial risk-adjustment model. We also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data, including the diagnosis data submitted with claims. In addition, we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts, to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model. 

CMS and the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, or HHS-OIG, perform audits of various companies’ risk adjustment diagnosis data submissions. We refer to these audits as Risk-Adjustment Data Validation Audits, or RADV audits. RADV audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices that influence the calculation of health status-related premium payments to MA plans. 

In 2012, CMS released an MA contract-level RADV methodology that would extrapolate the results of each CMS RADV audit sample to the audited MA contract’s entire health status-related risk adjusted premium amount for the year under audit. In doing so, CMS recognized “that the documentation standard used in RADV audits to determine a contract’s payment error (medical records) is different from the documentation standard used to develop the Part C risk-adjustment model (FFS claims).” To correct for this difference, CMS stated that it would apply a “Fee-for-Service Adjuster (FFS Adjuster)” as “an offset to the preliminary recovery amount.” This adjuster would be “calculated by CMS based on a RADV-like review of records submitted to support FFS claims data.” CMS stated that this methodology would apply to audits beginning with PY 2011. Humana relied on CMS’s 2012 guidance in submitting MA bids to CMS. Humana also launched a “Self-Audits” program in 2013 that applied CMS’s 2012 RADV audit methodology and included an estimated FFS Adjuster. Humana completed Self-Audits for PYs 2011-2016 and reported results to CMS. 

In October 2018, however, CMS issued a proposed rule announcing possible changes to the RADV audit methodology, including elimination of the FFS Adjuster. CMS proposed applying its revised methodology, including extrapolated recoveries without application of a FFS Adjuster, to RADV audits dating back to PY 2011. On January 30, 2023, CMS published a final rule related to the RADV audit methodology (Final RADV Rule). The Final RADV Rule confirmed CMS’s decision to eliminate the FFS Adjuster. The Final RADV Rule states CMS’s intention to extrapolate results from CMS and HHS-OIG RADV audits beginning with PY 2018, rather than PY 

107

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

2011 as proposed. However, CMS’s Final RADV Rule does not adopt a specific sampling, extrapolation or audit methodology. CMS instead stated its general plan to rely on “any statistically valid method . . . that is determined to be well-suited to a particular audit.” 

We believe that the Final RADV Rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). CMS failed to meet its legal obligations in the federal rulemaking process to give a reasoned justification for the rule or provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment. They also chose to apply the rule retroactively rather than prospectively, as required by law. Humana’s actuarially certified bids through PY 2023 preserved Humana’s position that CMS should apply an FFS Adjuster in any RADV audit that CMS intends to extrapolate. CMS confirmed its intent to apply the Final RADV Rule, including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements without the use of a FFS Adjuster, to CMS audits conducted for PY 2018 and subsequent years when it selected certain of Humana's MA contracts for PY 2018 RADV Audits. The Final RADV Rule, including the lack of a FFS Adjuster, and any related regulatory, industry or company reactions, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

On September 1, 2023, Humana Inc. and Humana Benefit Plan of Texas, Inc. filed suit against the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and Xavier Becerra in his official capacity as Secretary, in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division seeking a determination that the Final RADV Rule violates the APA and should be set aside. We remain committed to working alongside CMS to promote the integrity of the MA program as well as affordability and cost certainty for our members. It is critical that MA plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles, including the application of a FFS Adjuster, are in accordance with the requirements of the Social Security Act, which, if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

In addition, as part of our internal compliance efforts, we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to, among other things, our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk adjustment model. These reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to CMS that may, either individually or in the aggregate, be material. As such, the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

Our state-based Medicaid business accounted for approximately 8% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily serving members enrolled in Medicaid, and in certain circumstances members who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, under contracts with various states. 

Our military services business, which accounted for approximately 1% of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisted of the TRICARE T2017 East Region contract. We delivered services under the T2017 East Region contract from commencement on January 1, 2018 through expiration on December 31, 2024. The T2017 East Region contract comprised 32 states and approximately 6 million TRICARE beneficiaries. In December 2022, we were awarded the next generation of TRICARE Managed Care Support Contracts, or T-5, for the updated TRICARE East Region by the Defense Health Agency of the DoD. The T-5 East Region contract commenced on January 1, 2025 and comprises 24 states, and Washington D.C., and approximately 4.6 million beneficiaries. The transition period for the T-5 contract began in January 2024 and overlapped the final year of the T2017 contract. The length of the contract is one transition year followed by eight annual option periods, which, if all options are exercised, would result in a total contract length of nine years. 

The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative or regulatory action, including reductions in premium payments to us, regulatory restrictions on profitability, including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our Medicare Advantage profitability to our non-Medicare Advantage business profitability, or compare the profitability of various products within our Medicare Advantage business, and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other, or increases in member benefits or member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Legal Proceedings and Certain Regulatory Matters

From time to time, the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice has provided us with information requests, concerning our Medicare Part C risk adjustment practices. These requests relate to our oversight and submission of risk adjustment data generated by providers, as well as to our business and compliance practices related to risk adjustment data generated by our providers and by our Medicare Advantage Organizations. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice on these requests. 

On January 19, 2016, an individual filed a qui tam suit captioned United States of America ex rel. Steven Scott v. Humana Inc in United States District Court, Western District of Kentucky, Louisville division. As previously disclosed, during 2023, we accrued certain anticipated expenses in connection with this matter. On August 15, 2024, Humana settled the claims in this suit, and paid the United States $90 million.

On September 1, 2023, Humana Inc. and Humana Benefit Plan of Texas, Inc. filed suit against the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and Xavier Becerra in his official capacity as Secretary, in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division seeking a determination that the Final RADV Rule violates the APA and should be set aside. There is no assurance that we will prevail in the lawsuit. See “Government Contracts” in this Note 17 for additional information regarding this matter.

In June 2024, a putative stockholder class action was filed against Humana Inc. and certain of our current and former executive officers under the federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The case, now captioned In re Humana Inc. Securities Litigation, alleges that between July 2022 and October 2024, Humana made false or misleading statements in its periodic SEC filings and statements to the financial markets about our financial performance and the medical costs and Star Ratings in our Medicare Advantage business. The action seeks, among other things, unspecified compensatory damages and attorneys' fees. Between July and November 2024, parallel stockholder derivative actions captioned Silva v. Broussard, Spikes v. Broussard, and Noble v. Broussard, respectively, were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging that the same claimed acts and omissions underlying the federal securities law case also constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by certain of our current and former directors and executive officers. The actions seek, among other things, reforms to the Company's corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. We will vigorously defend against the allegations in all cases.

On October 18, 2024, Humana Inc., along with co-plaintiff Americans for Beneficiary Choice, filed suit against the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Xavier Becerra in his official capacity as Secretary, and Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, in her official capacity as Administrator, in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division, seeking a determination that they violated the Administrative Procedure Act in administering the Medicare Advantage and Part D Star Ratings program. We seek to set aside and vacate Humana’s 2025 Star Ratings and remand the matter to CMS for recalculation and to declare that CMS’s policy refusing to disclose all relevant data and information is arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful. There is no assurance that we will prevail in the lawsuit. For additional information on this matter, refer to Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.

Other Lawsuits and Regulatory Matters

Our current and past business practices are subject to review or other investigations by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and other state and federal regulatory authorities. These authorities regularly scrutinize the business practices of health insurance, health care delivery and benefits companies. These reviews focus on numerous facets of our business, including claims payment practices, statutory capital requirements, provider and vendor contracting and oversight, risk adjustment, competitive practices, commission payments, marketing payments, privacy issues, utilization management practices, pharmacy benefits, access to care, sales practices, and provision of care by our healthcare services businesses, among others. Some of these reviews have historically resulted in fines imposed on us and some have required changes to some of our practices. We continue to be subject to these reviews, which could result in additional fines or other sanctions being imposed on us or additional changes in some of our practices.

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We also are involved in various other lawsuits that arise, for the most part, in the ordinary course of our business operations, certain of which may be styled as class-action lawsuits. Among other matters, this litigation may include employment matters, claims of medical malpractice, bad faith, personal injury, nonacceptance or termination of providers, anticompetitive practices, improper rate setting, provider contract rate and payment disputes, including disputes over reimbursement rates required by statute, disputes arising from competitive procurement process, general contractual matters, intellectual property matters, and challenges to subrogation practices. Under state guaranty assessment laws, including those related to state cooperative failures in the industry, we may be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business as we do.

As a government contractor, we may also be subject to false claims litigation, such as qui tam lawsuits brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government, alleging that the government contractor submitted false claims to the government or related overpayments from the government, including, among other allegations, those resulting from coding and review practices under the Medicare risk adjustment model. Qui tam litigation is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene and assume control of the litigation. If the government does not intervene, the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own, on behalf of the government. We also are subject to other allegations of nonperformance of contractual obligations to providers, members, and others, including failure to properly pay claims, improper policy terminations, challenges to our implementation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program and other litigation.

A limited number of the claims asserted against us are subject to insurance coverage. Personal injury claims, claims for extra contractual damages, care delivery malpractice, and claims arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers, except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted. In addition, insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.

We record accruals for the contingencies discussed in the sections above to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No estimate of the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, if any, can be made at this time regarding the matters specifically described above because of the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, which also may be exacerbated by various factors, including: (i) the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; (ii) discovery is not complete; (iii) the proceeding is in its early stages; (iv) the matters present legal uncertainties; (v) there are significant facts in dispute; (vi) there are a large number of parties (including where it is uncertain how liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants); or (vii) there is a wide range of potential outcomes.

The outcome of any current or future litigation or governmental or internal investigations, including the matters described above, cannot be accurately predicted, nor can we predict any resulting judgments, penalties, fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities or as a result of actions by third parties. Nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation, judgments, penalties, fines or other sanctions could be substantial, and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, and may also affect our reputation.

18\. SEGMENT INFORMATION

Our two reportable segments, Insurance and CenterWell, are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. Our Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, utilizes these segment groupings and results of each segment, measured by income (loss) from operations, to assess performance and allocate resources primarily during our annual budget process and periodic forecast updates. 

110

Humana Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Insurance segment consists of Medicare benefits, marketed to individuals or directly via group Medicare accounts, as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide Medicaid, dual eligible demonstration, and Long-Term Support Services benefits, which we refer to collectively as our state-based contracts. This segment also includes products consisting of employer group commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health benefits, as well as administrative services only, or ASO. In addition, our Insurance segment includes our Military services business, primarily our T-2017 East Region contract, as well as the operations of our PBM business. 

In February 2023, we announced our planned exit from the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business, which includes all fully insured, self-funded and Federal Employee Health Benefit medical plans, as well as associated wellness and rewards programs. No other Humana health plan offerings are materially affected. Following a strategic review, we determined the Employer Group Commercial Medical Products business was no longer positioned to sustainably meet the needs of commercial members over the long term or support our long-term strategic plans. We anticipate the exit of this line of business to be finalized in the first half of 2025. 

The CenterWell segment includes our pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions operations. The segment also includes our strategic partnerships with WCAS to develop and operate senior-focused, payor-agnostic, primary care centers, as well as our minority ownership interest in hospice operations. Services offered by this segment are designed to enhance the overall healthcare experience. These services may lead to lower utilization associated with improved member health and/or lower drug costs. 

Our CenterWell intersegment revenues includes the operations of CenterWell Pharmacy (our mail-order pharmacy business), CenterWell Specialty Pharmacy, and retail pharmacies jointly located within CenterWell Senior Primary Care clinics. In addition, our CenterWell intersegment revenues include revenues earned by certain owned providers and our home solutions business, including fee-for-service and certain value-based arrangements with our health plans. 

We present our consolidated results of operations from the perspective of the health plans. As a result, the cost of providing benefits to our members, whether provided via a third-party provider or internally through a stand-alone subsidiary, is classified as benefits expense and excludes the portion of the cost for which the health plans do not bear responsibility, including member co-share amounts and government subsidies of $20.3 billion in 2024, $20.7 billion in 2023, and $19.7 billion in 2022. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense associated with certain businesses delivering benefits to our members, primarily associated with our primary care and pharmacy operations, are included with benefits expense. The amount of this expense was $129 million in 2024, $138 million in 2023, and $122 million in 2022. 

Other than those described previously, the accounting policies of each segment are the same and are described in Note 2. Transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of products and services rendered by our CenterWell segment, primarily pharmacy, primary care, and home solutions, to our Insurance segment customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded primarily at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often use the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at a corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations in the tables presenting segment results below. 

Premium and services revenues derived from our contracts with the federal government, as a percentage of our total premium and services revenues, were approximately 85% for 2024, 84% for 2023 and 82% for 2022.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

19\. REINSURANCE 

Certain blocks of insurance assumed in acquisitions, primarily life and annuities in run-off status are subject to reinsurance where some or all of the underwriting risk related to these policies has been ceded to a third-party. In addition, a large portion of our reinsurance takes the form of 100% coinsurance agreements where, in addition to all of the underwriting risk, all administrative responsibilities, including premium collections and claim payment, have also been ceded to a third-party. We acquired these policies and related reinsurance agreements with the purchase of stock of companies in which the policies were originally written. We acquired these companies for business reasons unrelated to these particular policies, including the companies’ other products and licenses necessary to fulfill strategic plans. 

A reinsurance agreement between two entities transfers the underwriting risk of policyholder liabilities to a reinsurer while the primary insurer retains the contractual relationship with the ultimate insured. As such, these reinsurance agreements do not completely relieve us of our potential liability to the ultimate insured. However, given the transfer of underwriting risk, our potential liability is limited to the credit exposure which exists should the reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations assumed under these reinsurance agreements.

Reinsurance recoverables represent the portion of future policy benefits payable and benefits payable that are covered by reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables, included in other long-term assets, were $167 million at December 31, 2024 and $173 million at December 31, 2023. The amount of these reinsurance recoverables resulting from 100% coinsurance agreements was approximately $167 million at December 31, 2024 and approximately $173 million at December 31, 2023. Premiums ceded were $5 million in 2024, $1 million in 2023 and $5 million in 2022. Benefits ceded were $4 million in 2024, $3 million in 2023, and $2 million in 2022. 

We evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers on a regular basis. Protective Life Insurance Company, with $154 million in reinsurance recoverables, is well-known and well-established with a AM Best rating of A+ at December 31, 2024. The remaining reinsurance recoverables of $13 million are divided between 7 other reinsurers, with none subject to funds withheld accounts or other financial guarantees supporting the repayment of these amounts.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Humana Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 

114

* * *

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of Incurred but not yet Reported Benefits Payable

As described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s incurred but not yet reported benefits payable (IBNR) was $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. Management develops its estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. For periods prior to the most recent two months, a completion factor method uses historical paid claims patterns to estimate the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. Changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes are taken into account in these estimates. For the most recent two months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of hospital admissions, recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, changes in medical management processes, product mix and workday seasonality.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of IBNR is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of IBNR; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the actuarial methodologies and management’s significant assumptions related to completion factors, per member per month claims trends, and the potential for moderately adverse conditions; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of IBNR, including controls over the actuarial methodologies and development of significant assumptions related to completion factors, per member per month claims trends, and the potential for moderately adverse conditions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with 

115

* * *

specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of IBNR. This independent estimate includes a range of reasonable outcomes, including outcomes under moderately adverse conditions, which are compared to management’s estimate of IBNR. Developing the independent estimate involved developing independent completion factors and per member per month claims trends assumptions using management’s data, testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions.

Impairment Assessments – Home Solutions Reporting Unit Goodwill and Certificates of Need Intangible Assets

As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $4.4 billion relates to the Home Solutions reporting unit. The Company’s other intangible assets balance was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $0.9 billion relates to the Certificates of Need intangible assets. Impairment tests are performed, at a minimum, in the fourth quarter of each year and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Management uses future discounted cash flows analyses to determine fair value. Key assumptions in management’s future discounted cash flow analyses include revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, operating cost trends, projected operating income, and discount rates. The annual impairment assessment of the Certificates of Need intangible assets resulted in an impairment charge of $0.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of the Home Solutions reporting unit goodwill and the Certificates of Need intangible assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Home Solutions reporting unit goodwill and the Certificates of Need intangible assets; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, projected operating income, including operating cost trends, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessments, including controls over the significant assumptions used in the valuation of the Home Solutions reporting unit goodwill and the Certificates of Need intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's processes for developing the fair value estimates of the Home Solutions reporting unit goodwill and the Certificates of Need intangible assets; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flows analyses; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the analyses; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates, projected operating income, including operating cost trends, and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates, long-term growth rates and projected operating income, including operating cost trends involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the past performance of the Home Solutions reporting unit and the Certificates of Need intangible assets and whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company’s discounted cash flows analyses and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to the long-term growth rates and discount rates.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Management’s Responsibility for Financial Statements and Other Information

We are responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts based on our estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements.

Our control environment is the foundation for our system of internal control over financial reporting and is embodied in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which we currently refer to as the Humana Inc. Ethics Every Day. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent outside directors, meets periodically with members of management, the internal auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss internal controls over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters. Our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to members of senior management and the Board of Directors.

Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2024, we as the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer of the Company have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

117

* * *

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we determined that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, who also audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report which appears on pages 114-116.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

(a) None.

(b) During the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.

SCHEDULE I—PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1\. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Parent company financial information has been derived from our consolidated financial statements and excludes the accounts of all operating subsidiaries. This information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.

2\. TRANSACTIONS WITH SUBSIDIARIES

Services Fee

Through intercompany service agreements approved, if required, by state regulatory authorities, Humana Inc., our parent company, charges a services fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries including information systems, disbursement, investment and cash administration, marketing, legal, finance, and medical and executive management oversight.

Dividends

Cash dividends received from subsidiaries and included as a component of net cash provided by operating activities were $1.5 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023, and $1.3 billion in 2022.

Guarantee

Through indemnity agreements approved by state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by our parent company in the event of insolvency for: (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent has also guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries and funding to maintain required statutory capital levels of certain other regulated subsidiaries.

3\. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, or ordinary dividends, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an extraordinary dividend requiring prior regulatory approval. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required.

Although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements vary significantly at the state level. Our state regulated insurance subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $13.2 billion and $12.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements of $11.4 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2025 is approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate. The amount, timing and mix of ordinary and extraordinary dividend payments will vary due to state regulatory requirements, the level of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. Actual dividends that were paid to our parent company were approximately $1.5 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023, and $1.3 billion in 2022.
