These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control and are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices and demand for the company’s products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company’s global supply chain, including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East and the global response to these hostilities; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; the company’s ability to realize anticipated cost savings and efficiencies associated with enterprise structural cost reduction initiatives; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; changes in projected future cash flows; timing of crude oil liftings; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; pace and scale of the development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company’s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the risk that regulatory approvals and clearances related to the Hess Corporation (Hess) transaction are not obtained or are not obtained in a timely manner or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the company and Hess; potential delays in consummating the Hess transaction, including as a result of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement; risks that such ongoing arbitration is not satisfactorily resolved and the potential transaction fails to be consummated; uncertainties as to whether the potential transaction, if consummated, will achieve its anticipated economic benefits, including as a result of risks associated with third party contracts containing material consent, anti-assignment, transfer or other provisions that may be related to the potential transaction that are not waived or otherwise satisfactorily resolved; the company’s ability to integrate Hess’ operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; changes to the company’s capital allocation strategies; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 27 in this report, and as updated in the future. Other unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

General Development of Business

Summary Description of Chevron 

Chevron Corporation1, a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.

A list of the company’s significant subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1.

Overview of Petroleum Industry 

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. 

Operating Environment 

Refer to Business Environment and Outlook of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.

Chevron’s Strategic Direction

Chevron’s strategy is to leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. Our objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. We are leveraging our capabilities, assets and customer relationships as we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas, as well as advance new products and solutions that reduce the carbon emissions of major industries. We aim to grow our oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies.

1 Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Hiring, Development and Retention

The company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a global, diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored by an environment of personal growth and engagement. The company’s philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. The company recruits new employees in a variety of ways, including through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills.

Chevron’s learning and development programs are designed to help employees build technical, operating and leadership capabilities. The company’s leadership reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are refined on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of the business. The company invests in developing leadership at every level, including coaching programs for frontline supervisors, managers and individual contributors. Chevron invests in developing and upskilling employees, including things such as tailored generative AI training for leaders, practitioners and the broader workforce. In addition, the company offers the Digital Scholar Program, preparing employees with advanced technology skills through one-year Master of Science degrees in Engineering and Management.

In addition, leadership reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning. 

Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The voluntary attrition for this population in 2024 was 3.1 percent, in line with historical rates. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company’s commitment to employee development, competitive pay and benefits, and culture.

Diversity and Inclusion

Chevron believes human ingenuity is best able to solve difficult problems when people with different ideas, experiences and backgrounds work together in an inclusive environment. 

The company has 11 employee networks (voluntary groups open to all employees with shared interests). The Chairman’s Inclusion Council provides employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the executive leadership team to discuss how employee networks can help reinforce the company’s values and achieve its business objectives. 

Diversity and inclusion at Chevron means zero tolerance for discrimination based on race, sex or other protected characteristics, and a deep respect for the cultures in which we operate. Chevron rejects the use of quotas and focuses on removing barriers to equal opportunity, fostering diversity, and ensuring that selection decisions are based on merit.

Employee Engagement 

Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies. The company regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture. Our surveys indicate high levels of employee engagement compared to our industry. 

Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The company’s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. The company has set clear expectations for leaders to deliver operational excellence by prioritizing the safety and health of its workforce, and the protection of communities, the environment and the company’s assets. 

Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns.

Description of Business and Properties

The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects2 in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. These activities are managed by the Oil, Products and Gas organization. Tabulations of segment income statements for the three years ended December 31, 2024, and assets as of the end of 2024 and 2023 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 14 Operating Segments and Geographic Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Note 15 Investments and Advances and Note 18 Property, Plant and Equipment. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s Capital Expenditures. 

Upstream 

Reserves 

Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company’s proved reserves by geographic area for each year-end from 2022 through 2024. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.

The company’s proved reserves at year-end 2024 were approximately 9.8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent (BOE). The largest reductions from year-end 2023 were from record production and the sale of assets in Canada, and the largest additions were from extensions and discoveries in the Permian and DJ Basins. At December 31, 2024, 41 percent of the company’s net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 16 percent were located in Australia and 13 percent were located in Kazakhstan.

The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2022 through 2024 are shown in the following table:

Review of Ongoing Activities in Key Areas 

Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2024 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in the section Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1. 

The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long lead time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Projected start-up timing for nonoperated projects are per operator’s estimate.

United States

Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, California and the Gulf of America. Acreage for the United States can be found in the Acreage table. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the Net Production of Crude Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas table.

As one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, Chevron continues to develop its advantaged portfolio of 1,780,000 net acres in the Delaware and Midland basins in west Texas and southeast New Mexico and is expected to achieve one million barrels of net oil-equivalent production per day in 2025. The asset is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations, staging the development for optimized capacity utilization of facilities and infrastructure. The company has implemented a factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed using hydraulic fracture stimulation. This manufacturing-style process, combined with advantaged acreage holdings and technological advancements, have enabled productivity improvements across unique geological locations throughout the basin. Acreage transactions enabling longer laterals and the company’s diversified land assets via non-operated joint ventures and royalty positions have also contributed to higher returns. The company continued to progress water handling initiatives and ongoing emission reductions, including the partial or full electrification of drilling and hydraulic fracturing fleets, and the expansion of electricity sources with two new solar projects reaching final investment decision in 2024. Chevron’s 2024 net daily production in the Permian Basin averaged 405,000 barrels of crude oil, 251,000 barrels of NGLs and 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

Chevron also holds approximately 72,000 net acres in the Haynesville Shale in east Texas. The company continues to pursue strategic opportunities for these assets.

Chevron is the largest oil and natural gas producer in Colorado, where development is focused across approximately 580,000 net acres in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. Chevron follows a factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed using hydraulic fracture stimulation. It has also implemented facility design and electrification improvements to consolidate assets and remove facilities, reducing surface footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. In 2024, Chevron’s net daily production in Colorado averaged 132,000 barrels of crude oil, 107,000 barrels of NGLs and 930 million cubic feet of natural gas. Chevron also has operations in Colorado’s Piceance Basin, as well as an acreage position in Wyoming.

Chevron New Energies The new energies organization is focused on developing new businesses with the aim to support the company’s objectives to lower the carbon intensity of its operations and enable growth opportunities with the potential to generate competitive returns. These include additional fuel solutions utilizing hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia, carbon emissions management through carbon capture and offsets, and power generation for data centers. The company is also pursuing opportunities in other emerging areas, including enhanced geothermal to deliver non-intermittent lower carbon power, and lithium extraction and production for battery and other applications. 

Environmental Protection The company designs, operates and maintains its facilities to avoid potential spills or leaks and to minimize the impact of those that may occur. Chevron requires its facilities and operations to have operating standards and processes and emergency response plans that address significant risks identified through site-specific risk and impact assessments. Chevron also requires that sufficient resources be available to execute these plans. In the unlikely event that a major spill or leak occurs, Chevron also maintains a Worldwide Emergency Response Team comprised of employees who are trained in various aspects of emergency response, including post-incident remediation. 

To complement the company’s capabilities, Chevron maintains active membership in international oil spill response cooperatives, including the Marine Spill Response Corporation, which operates in U.S. territorial waters, and Oil Spill Response, Ltd., which operates globally. The company is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, whose primary mission is to expediently deploy containment equipment and systems to capture and contain crude oil in the unlikely event of a future loss of control of a deepwater well in the Gulf of America. In addition, the company is a member of the Subsea Well Response Project, which has the objective to further develop the industry’s capability to contain and shut in subsea well control incidents in different regions of the world. 

The company aims to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations and comply with the related laws and regulations to which it is subject. Refer to Item 1A.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition.

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS

Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The most significant factor that affects the company’s results of operations are the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, which can be influenced by general economic conditions and level of economic 

20

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Table of Contents  

growth, including low or negative growth; industry production and inventory levels; technology advancements, including those in pursuit of a lower carbon economy; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers; weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control; competing fuel prices; geopolitical risks; the pace of energy transition; customer and consumer preferences and the use of substitutes; and governmental regulations, policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

Extended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depend.

The scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, exploration or technology, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. 

The company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.

Chevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition. 

Cyberattacks and events affecting Chevron’s operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors, 

21

* * *

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Table of Contents  

including during organizational changes, relocating work to international geographies, or other corporate transactions; political tensions; war or other military conflicts; or civil unrest. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s operational technology networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the company is increasingly experiencing cyber incidents related to its third-party vendors. Some third-party vendors house the company’s critical data and proprietary information on their IT systems, including the cloud; others have access to Chevron’s IT systems or provide software through which threat actors could gain access or introduce malware to Chevron’s IT systems. Our use of third-party software, services and support may also result in unintentional, non-malicious events or outages that affect our ability to operate critical business systems. Regardless of the precise method or form, events affecting our networks or digital infrastructure could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.

The company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the energy industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, standards, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. 

The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 

Chevron may not complete the acquisition of Hess Corporation within the time frame the company anticipates or at all, which could have adverse effects on Chevron The completion of the acquisition of Hess Corporation (Hess) is subject to a number of conditions, including approval of any Guyanese governmental body, agency or authority that asserts its approval is required in connection with the transaction, which makes the completion and timing of the completion of the merger uncertain.

Hess Guyana Exploration Limited (HGEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, is currently in arbitration with respect to the right of first refusal (Stabroek ROFR) contained in an operating agreement among HGEL, affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon), and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) regarding the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. The arbitration merits hearing about the applicability of the Stabroek ROFR to the merger has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in approximately the following three months. If the arbitration does not result in a confirmation that the Stabroek ROFR is inapplicable to the merger, and if Chevron, Hess, Exxon and/or CNOOC do not otherwise agree upon an acceptable resolution, then there would be a failure of a closing condition under the merger agreement, in which case the merger would not close.

On December 7, 2023, Chevron and Hess each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (Second Request) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Following the FTC review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, 

22

* * *

| | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Table of Contents  

Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended, to close the merger following satisfactory resolution of the ongoing arbitration proceedings regarding preemptive rights in the Stabroek Block joint operating agreement. Additionally, if any Guyanese governmental body, agency or authority of competent jurisdiction asserts that its approval is required as a result of the consequences of the merger in Guyana on Hess’ assets in Guyana (which has not occurred as of the filing date of this report), approval of such governmental body, agency or authority will become a condition to each party’s obligation to complete the merger.

The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. A failure to complete the acquisition would mean that we will not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the acquisition that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the company’s business after the transaction or materially delay the completion of the acquisition. A delay in completing the acquisition could cause the company to realize some or all of the benefits later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in additional transaction costs or in other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the acquisition. 

Acquisitions may cause Chevron’s financial results to differ from the company’s expectations or the expectations of the investment community, the company may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the acquisition may disrupt the company’s current plans or operations The success of the pending acquisition of Hess will depend, in part, on Chevron’s ability to successfully integrate the business of Hess and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies. Difficulties in integrating Hess may result in the failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframes, in operational challenges, and in the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns, as well as in unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition, which may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial results.

LEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS

Chevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron’s operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company’s current or former operations or products on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 

For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see Note 16 Litigation.

Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business The company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes, tariffs, royalties, fees, penalties or other costs. In a number of locations, including the European Union, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness, return on investments, or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate, such as sanctions imposed in Venezuela and Russia, which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results in these countries. In addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those 

23

* * *

---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | Table of Contents  

designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability. 

Legislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose Chevron to additional tax liabilities Changes in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company’s control. Chevron’s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations, including but not limited to, substantive changes in, reductions in, or the repeal or expiration of, tax incentives. Furthermore, Chevron’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world. There is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that Chevron has reflected on the company’s tax returns, in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 

During periods of high profitability for certain companies or industries, there are often calls for increased taxes on profits, often called “windfall profit” taxes. Governments in various jurisdictions, including California and Australia, have announced, proposed, or implemented windfall profit taxes for companies operating in the energy and oil and gas sectors. Such taxes may be imposed on us or may be increased in the future in these or other jurisdictions. The imposition of, or increase in, such windfall profit taxes could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability. 

For information concerning the company’s tax liabilities, see Note 17 Taxes and Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments.

Legislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products, resulting in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition Chevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. 

Legislation, regulation, and other government actions related to GHG emissions and climate change could reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products and/or continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce its return on investment. The Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries in which we operate have adopted and may adopt additional policies intended to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program, performance standards or other mechanisms, or to attempt to indirectly advance reduction of GHG emissions through restrictive permitting, procurement standards, trade barriers, minimum renewable usage requirements, financing standards, standards or requirements for environmental benefit claims, increased GHG reporting and climate-related disclosure requirements, or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. For example, the company operates in jurisdictions with developing or existing programs, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S., California’s Cap-and-Trade Program and Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and mandates such as the California Air Resources Board Advanced Clean Cars II regulations, as well as other indirect regulation of GHG emissions, which may, among other things, ban or restrict technologies or products that use the company’s products. GHG emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons; power generation; the conversion of crude oil, natural gas and biofeedstocks into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and other products; and customers’ and consumers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. In addition, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) implements various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. Although the IRA offers incentives that could support certain lower carbon lines of business, those same incentives could negatively impact supply and/or demand for our oil and gas products in the future or any existing or future lower carbon business lines. Many of these actions, as well as customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products, and actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.

Similar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability, as well as render the extraction of the company’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions, and shifting customer and consumer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources; make the company’s products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources; impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. For example, some jurisdictions are in various stages of design, adoption, and implementation of policies and programs that cap emissions and/or require short-, medium-, and long-term GHG reductions by operators at the asset or facility level, which may not be technologically feasible, or which could require significant capital expenditure, increase costs of or limit production, result in impairment of assets and limit Chevron’s ability to cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions across its global portfolio. Additionally, some jurisdictions are in various stages of enacting or implementing legislation that imposes retroactive liability on estimated past GHG emissions by certain energy producers and refiners.

The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the use of standardized carbon accounting, the extent to which Chevron would be able to receive, generate, purchase, or retire credits, the price and availability of credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover, or continue to recover, the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes and legal challenges, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and trade-offs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions, including the responses of consumers to such changes. 

Attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters impacts our company Attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, evolving societal, investor and governmental pressure on companies to address ESG matters, and potential customer and consumer use of substitutes to Chevron’s products have resulted and may continue to result in changes to the portfolio and company activities, increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, impaired participation in public discourse and debate by the company relating to mandatory and voluntary standards and regulations, and damage to our reputation. For example, increasing attention to ESG matters, including climate change, has resulted and may result in the future in shifting demand for our hydrocarbon products, and have resulted in additional litigation and governmental investigations, or threats thereof, against the company. For instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for information relating to climate change, methane leak detection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or demands are possible. At this time, Chevron cannot predict the ultimate impact any Congressional or other investigations may have on the company. Information related to climate-change related litigation matters is included in Note 16 Litigation under the heading “Climate Change.”

Some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, voluntary carbon-related and target-setting frameworks have been developed that may limit the ability of certain sectors, including the oil and gas sector, from accessing capital, and may result in exclusion of the company’s equity or debt from being included as an investment option in portfolios. In addition, some stakeholders, including some of our investors, have divergent and evolving views on our ESG-related strategies and priorities, vis-à-vis our lines of business, calling for focus on increased production of oil and gas products rather than lower carbon business lines and climate-related targets. These circumstances, among others, may result in pressure from activists on production; unfavorable reputational impacts, including inaccurate perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual ESG policies, practices and performance; diversion of management’s attention and resources; and proxy fights, among other material adverse impacts on our businesses.

In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks (including entities commonly referred to as “raters and rankers”). Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG matters, including human rights, biodiversity, waste and water, have increased, and may continue to increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.

Our ambitions and disclosures related to ESG matters subject us to numerous risks that may negatively impact our reputation and stock price or result in other material adverse impacts to the company Chevron has set a number of lower carbon-related ambitions, which may include aspirations, targets, guidance, objectives, metrics, and/or goals. In particular, Chevron has announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for upstream carbon intensity and portfolio carbon intensity. Chevron regularly evaluates its ambitions and expects to change or eliminate some of these aspirations, targets, and other ambitions for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors. 

Our ability to achieve any ambition, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, including those outlined in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 35 through 37, and any new businesses, is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron’s control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC’s Global Warming Potentials and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals; (7) customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners, and governments.

The standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, disclosing, marketing and advertising related to ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Further, our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time. Either of these circumstances may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period. 

Our existing processes and controls may not align with evolving voluntary and mandatory standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics. Our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, including through non-public processes, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. For example, Chevron’s methane intensity target is calculated based on Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Methodologies for the Oil and Natural Gas Industry (2021), which requires use of local regulatory reporting methodologies where applicable. The U.S. EPA has adopted notable changes to reporting methodologies in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (40 C.F.R. Part 98.230), which are applicable to Chevron’s U.S. operations. We expect these adopted changes may increase our reported emissions in future years, and therefore, increase our reported methane intensity. In addition, Chevron participates, along with other companies, institutes, universities, trade associations and other organizations, in various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects that express various ambitions, aspirations and goals related to climate change, emissions and energy transition. Chevron’s individual ambitions, future performance or policies may differ from the ambitions of such organizations or the individual ambitions of other participants in these various initiatives, campaigns, and other projects, and Chevron may unilaterally change its individual ambitions. Achievement of or efforts to achieve ambitions such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives has, and may continue to, increase costs, and, in addition, may require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company’s business plans, operations and financial results, potentially resulting in reduction to the economic end-of-life of certain assets, impairing the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts. Our failure or

perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such ambitions within the timelines we announce, or at all, or to satisfy various reporting standards and regulations could have a negative impact on the company’s reputation, investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating the company’s approach to ESG matters, stock price, and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS

Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the company’s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; estimates for decommissioning obligations, including for previously divested assets; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other post-employment benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions, the pace of energy transition, or changes in the company’s outlook on commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

Chevron’s business and proprietary information, information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks are essential to its success. The company’s cybersecurity program is designed to protect its information assets and operations from external and internal cyber threats by identifying and appropriately managing and mitigating risks while ensuring business resiliency. This program is integrated within the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, which is the company’s systematic approach to identifying, managing and assessing major risks and safeguards, including cybersecurity risks. Chevron uses a risk-based information security process aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework to identify, prioritize and mitigate cyber risks. 

The company’s worldwide team of cybersecurity professionals undertakes a range of preemptive activities to protect its people, assets and reputation globally. The company also leverages internal and external resources to monitor cybersecurity threats to its systems and networks and to understand the broader threat environment. The company seeks to remove exploitable weaknesses in its systems or devices before they become a threat. Chevron security experts use automated threat intelligence feeds to increase vulnerability awareness, taking action to mitigate the highest risks. The company’s cybersecurity guardrails, which are high-level design requirements expected to be built into any new digital solutions being deployed, are also updated on an ongoing basis to align with changes in industry standards and the evolving threat environment.

Chevron’s cyber risk management process includes testing and risk assessments of technologies, third-party suppliers, and its IT and OT networks. These assessments ensure that our focus is on the highest priorities to maintain the security of our company’s assets. To further protect the company’s systems and data, Chevron’s cybersecurity organization has threat intelligence capabilities to monitor security breaches impacting third-party suppliers. As third-party risks increase, the company’s approach to third-party supplier risk management and qualification continues to evolve, including the ongoing expansion of its current supplier risk management program beyond IT vendors to other high-risk, third-party vendors.

Chevron’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) oversees Chevron’s broader IT program, which includes the company’s cybersecurity program and its ability to remediate and recover from a cybersecurity incident to minimize business and operational impacts. Chevron’s CIO joined Chevron in 2024, bringing more than 20 years of experience leading global innovation initiatives in digital, data, full supply chains, vehicle commerce, energy, and IT operations for technology and automotive companies. Chevron’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) reports to the CIO and leads a global cybersecurity team.

Chevron operates four Cyber Intelligence Centers around the world, some co-located with critical assets, with cyber professionals who monitor and respond to cyber threats 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to limit the scope and impact of cyber incidents in its networks. The cybersecurity organization provides the IT leadership, which includes Chevron’s CIO, with regular cybersecurity operations reports detailing prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation efforts associated with cyber incidents, both on Chevron’s networks and third-party supplier networks. The leadership of the cybersecurity organization has authority to mobilize a cross-functional cyber incident response team, including outside cybersecurity experts, to drive mitigation and remediation actions. Status updates on incidents are provided to senior management and to the Board, as appropriate. 

The company’s dedicated cyber risk organization meets regularly with business units to raise cyber risk awareness and keep diverse cybersecurity skill sets connected across the enterprise. Chevron has invested in broad cybersecurity awareness and required training to educate those with access to Chevron’s networks on company policy and best practices. The company conducts regular phishing tests to train and assess its workforce’s ability to identify malicious emails. 

Chevron’s Corporate Audit Department has a dedicated team responsible for IT and information security (including cybersecurity) audits. Chevron also leverages external resources to reinforce its cybersecurity capabilities. On a regular basis, external consultants provide a maturity assessment of the company’s cybersecurity program. 

The company’s approach to managing risks, including cybersecurity risks, is embedded within the enterprise Operational Excellence (OE) Management System (OEMS). The OEMS provides a systematic process that enables the company to manage risk and implement safeguards and foster a culture of learning across different focus areas for Chevron’s business, including cybersecurity. The company’s Business Continuity Planning OE Process, a component of the OEMS, is designed to prepare Chevron to continue operations during an unplanned event or disruption, which aligns with its OE objective to prevent high-consequence security and cybersecurity incidents. Chevron works to identify critical business processes and dependent IT applications and document the processes for continuing operations without IT systems. Cross-functional teams also conduct regular multidisciplinary exercises to test and improve response plans.

The Board provides oversight of Chevron’s cybersecurity program, receives reports from management on cybersecurity risks in connection with Chevron’s operations and projects, and also reviews cybersecurity risks as part of the company’s broader annual ERM process. In support of the Board’s oversight of the company’s policies and processes with respect to risk management and the company’s major financial risk exposures, including cybersecurity, the Audit Committee meets with Chevron’s CISO and CIO at least twice a year to review cybersecurity risks and implications, including the results of independent third-party assessments. The CISO and CIO present cybersecurity matters to the Board of Directors at least annually. The CISO and CIO also provide new Board members with a cybersecurity briefing as part of the onboarding process.

To date, the company has not experienced a cybersecurity threat or incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition; however, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees. Despite the cybersecurity measures that the company is taking to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that such measures will be sufficient to protect the company’s systems, information, intellectual property and other assets from significant harm and that future cybersecurity incidents will not have a material adverse effect on the company or its results of operations or financial condition or cause reputational or other harm to the company. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors on pages 21 through 22 for further discussion of cyberattacks and the associated risks to Chevron’s business.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

The following is a description of legal proceedings that involve governmental authorities as a party and the company reasonably believes would result in $1.0 million or more of monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, under federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment. 

As previously disclosed, on May 20, 2024, the New Mexico Environment Department issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Chevron for alleged violations of state and federal regulations of air quality between October 2022 and September 2023 at different Chevron facilities in New Mexico. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1.0 million or more.

On May 26, 2023, Chevron’s refinery in El Segundo, California notified the U.S. EPA that it had inadvertently overstated the number of biofuel credits generated by co-processing in 2022 in violation of the Renewable Fuel Standard program. The parties began negotiating a resolution of the violation in October 2024. Resolution of the violation may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1.0 million or more. 

On October 31, 2024, California’s Bay Area Air District (formerly Bay Area Air Quality Management District) issued two NOVs for the alleged noncompliance with permit conditions that governed operation of certain equipment associated with low-NOx burners at the thermal oxidizers and stack gas heaters for sulfur recovery units 1 & 2 at Chevron’s refinery in Richmond, California. Resolution of the alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of $1.0 million or more. 

As previously disclosed, in April 2015, Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) entered into a joint consent decree (Consent Decree) with the United States Department of Justice, the U.S. EPA, and the State of Colorado to improve emission control systems at a number of condensate storage tanks within the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. The associated civil penalty was paid by Noble previously, and Chevron paid $1.5 million in stipulated penalties for noncompliance with the Consent Decree in August 2024. On December 20, 2024, the parties entered a joint stipulation terminating the Consent Decree, which was approved by the U.S. District Court. Accordingly, the Consent Decree has been terminated and no outstanding obligations remain.

Business Environment and Outlook 

Chevron Corporation is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and Venezuela. 

The company’s objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.

Some governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements; the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures and evolving standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emission reductions and removals. 

Some of these policies and programs include renewable and low carbon fuel standards, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard program in the U.S. and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard; programs that price GHG emissions, including

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations| Financial Table of Contents  

California’s Cap-and-Trade Program; performance standards, including methane-specific regulations such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources; and measures that provide various incentives for lower carbon activities, including carbon capture and storage and the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Requirements for these and other similar policies and programs are complex, ever changing, program specific and encompass: (1) the blending of renewable fuels into transportation fuels; (2) the purchasing, selling, utilizing and retiring of allowances and carbon credits; and (3) other emissions reduction measures including efficiency improvements and capturing GHG emissions. These compliance policies and programs have had and may continue to have negative impacts on the company now and in the future including, but not limited to, the displacement of hydrocarbon and other products and/or the impairment of assets. These policies have also enabled opportunities for Chevron in its lower carbon business lines. For example, Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (REG) produces most of Chevron’s renewable fuels offering and generates a substantial amount of the company’s carbon credit generation activities. Although we expect the company’s costs to comply with these policies and programs to continue to increase, these costs currently do not have a material impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations. 

Significant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company’s activities and market conditions. As discussed below, in 2021, the company announced planned capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come. 

Chevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the demand for energy. Chevron believes that broad, market-based mechanisms are the most efficient approach to addressing GHG emission reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. 

The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers’ and consumers’ demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies. To grow its new businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships. The company’s oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon market, economic, legislative and regulatory forces, among other factors.

In 2021, Chevron announced aspirations and targets that align with its strategy, as noted below. Chevron uses emissions intensity targets, which enable the company to assess, quantify and transparently communicate its own carbon performance in a standardized way. Chevron regularly evaluates its aspirations, targets and goals and expects to change or eliminate some of its aspirations, targets and goals for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors. 

The company’s ability to achieve any aspiration, target or goal is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron’s control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations| Financial Table of Contents  

sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC’s Global Warming Potentials and the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals; (7) customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners and governments. Please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 23 through 27 for further discussion of GHG regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business, including the risks impacting Chevron’s strategy, aspirations, targets and disclosures related to environmental, social, and governance matters.

2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions on an equity basis by 2050. The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; enabling policies and other actions by governing authorities, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits; successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners and governments; market conditions; and the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits.

2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam) and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The 2028 GHG emissions intensity targets on an equity ownership basis include:

•Oil production GHG intensity of 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO2e/boe), 

•Gas production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO2e/boe, 

•Methane intensity of 2 kg CO2e/boe, and 

•Flaring GHG intensity of 3 kg CO2e/boe. 

The company also targets zero routine flaring by 2030 as outlined in the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative. 

2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the company’s upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company’s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028. 

Planned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 In 2021, the company guided to capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon ambitions, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments including in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. Beyond 2028, the company anticipates capital spending will be necessary to progress the company’s 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and building of its lower carbon business lines. 

Since 2021, the company has spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022.

Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 17 Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued model rules for a new 15 percent global minimum tax (Pillar Two), and various jurisdictions in which the company operates enacted or are in the process of enacting Pillar Two legislation. Certain aspects of the tax under the Pillar Two framework became effective in 2024 in some jurisdictions and will be effective in 2025 (or later) in others. Pillar Two did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations in 2024. Although we do not currently expect that Pillar Two will have a material impact on our future results of operations, we are continuing to evaluate the impact of pending legislative adoption by individual countries. 

Supply Chain and Inflation Impacts The company is actively managing its contracting, procurement and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and facilitate supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of the company’s operational goals. Third party costs for capital and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market-based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, which may result in a lag before the company’s costs reflect changes in market trends.

Trends in the costs of goods and services vary by spend category. The labor market remains tight, and suppliers are passing along wage rate increases for labor intensive operations. Chevron has applied inflation mitigation strategies in an effort to temper these cost increases, including fixed price and index-based contracts. Lead times for key capital equipment remain long and availability of offshore and specialized equipment is under pressure, with some experiencing upward pricing movements. In the United States, cost pressures for materials and standard onshore drilling and completion equipment continue to ease. Chevron has addressed equipment cost increases and long lead times by partnering with suppliers on demand planning, volume commitments, standardization and scope optimization. 

In February 2025, the U.S. announced the imposition of tariffs on imports from several U.S. trade partners and could announce additional tariffs in future periods. There is significant uncertainty as to the duration of these and any further tariffs, and the impacts these tariffs and any corresponding retaliatory tariffs will have on the company and its suppliers. The financial impacts of the tariffs are currently not expected to be material; however, the ultimate impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain.

Refer to the Cautionary Statement Relevant to Forward-Looking Information on page 2 and to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. 

Acquisition and Disposition of Assets The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. The company is targeting $10-15 billion of asset sales over the five-year period ending in 2028. From 2024 through January 2025, the company has generated approximately $8 billion of asset sales proceeds. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. 

In addition, some assets are divested along with their related liabilities, such as decommissioning obligations. In certain instances, such transferred obligations have returned and may continue to return to the company and result in losses that could be significant. For example, in fourth quarter 2023, the company recognized charges for decommissioning obligations from certain previously divested assets in the Gulf of America. In 2024, the company spent $235 million related to these obligations and anticipates spending an additional $200-300 million annually through 2033. To the extent the current owners of the company’s previously divested assets default on their decommissioning obligations, regulators may require that Chevron assume such obligations. The company could have additional significant obligations revert, primarily in the United States. The company is not currently aware of any such obligations that are reasonably possible to be material. Refer to Note 24. Other Contingencies and Commitments for additional information.

In December 2024, the company sold its 20 percent non-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project and 70 percent operated interest in the Duvernay shale in Alberta, Canada, to Canadian Natural Resources Limited for $6.5 billion before taxes, and expects to make tax payments totaling $1.5 billion in first quarter 2025. In 2024, these assets produced 86 thousand barrels of oil-equivalent per day and generated over $2.2 billion of sales and approximately $590 million of operational net income. As part of the sale, the buyer assumed decommissioning obligations for the transferred assets.

In October 2023, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Hess Corporation. Refer to Note 30. Agreement to Acquire Hess Corporation for additional information.

Other Impacts The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.

In fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company’s pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods. 

Earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are described as follows:

Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. 

The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.

In April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future Growth Project, which is expected to contribute to higher free cash flow.

Chevron has interests in Venezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in Venezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received General License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in Venezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this General License. The financial results for Chevron’s business in Venezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company’s results. Crude oil liftings in Venezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company’s results. The company’s independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.

Chevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse event or incident affecting CPC operations, which CPC has experienced from time to time, could have a negative impact on the Tengiz field and the company’s results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.

Other governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or export crude in the region around Russia. 

Chevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company’s results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.

Chevron operates and holds interests in the Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields in Bangladesh. Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company’s operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company’s results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.

Commodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $81 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $83 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Brent price was $75 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $76 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $78 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the WTI price was $71 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the full-year 2024, compared to $2.56 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Henry Hub price was $4.42 per MCF. See page 47 for the company’s U.S. and international average realizations for each of the past three years.

Crude prices in 2024 were influenced by geopolitical conflict and OPEC+ supply restraint, which was offset by factors such as non-OPEC supply growth and slowing demand growth. 

In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, prices for natural gas are also impacted by regional supply and demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, lower Henry Hub prices were driven by high storage levels, strong production, and delayed starts to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.

Outside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for LNG are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.

Production The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2024 was 3.3 million barrels per day, 7 percent higher than in 2023 primarily due to the full-year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin. About 20 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2024 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo.

The company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2025 to increase six to eight percent over 2024, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $70 per barrel and excluding expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in production; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future

Proved Reserves Net proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 9.8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2024, a decrease from year-end 2023. The reserve replacement ratio in 2024 was negative 4 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 72 percent and 88 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2022 and each year-end from 2022 through 2024, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2024.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 43 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.

Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.

Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.

The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.

Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.

All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

U.S. upstream earnings increased by $3.5 billion primarily due to higher sales volumes of $2.2 billion, including from legacy PDC assets, and the absence of charges from decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets in the Gulf of America of $1.9 billion, partly offset by lower realizations of $790 million.

Net oil-equivalent production was up 250,000 barrels per day, or 19 percent, primarily due to full-year of legacy PDC production and growth in the Permian Basin.

International upstream earnings decreased by $2.3 billion primarily due to lower realizations of $770 million, higher operating expenses of $580 million, lower sales volumes of $570 million and absence of favorable one-time tax benefit in Nigeria of $560 million. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $19 million between periods. 

Net oil-equivalent production was down 32,000 barrels per day, or 2 percent. The decrease was primarily due to downtime at TCO and Nigeria, and withdrawal from Myanmar, partly offset by entitlement effects.

Income tax expense (benefit) | $| 9,757 | | | | $| 8,173 | | | $| 14,066 |   

The increase in income tax expense in 2024 of $1.6 billion was primarily due to the tax impacts of the asset sales in Canada, partially offset by the decrease in total income before tax for the company of $2.1 billion. The decrease in income before taxes for the company was primarily the result of lower downstream margins, lower upstream realizations, higher operating expenses, in part due to severance charges, partially offset by the absence of charges from decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets, higher sales volumes and favorable foreign exchange impacts.

U.S. income before tax decreased from $8.6 billion in 2023 to $8.1 billion in 2024. This $0.5 billion decrease in income was primarily driven by lower downstream margins, higher operating expenses, in part due to severance charges, and lower upstream realizations, partially offset by the absence of charges related to decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets and higher sales volumes. The increase of $0.1 billion in U.S. income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $1.8 billion in 2023 to $1.9 billion in 2024, was primarily driven by current period unfavorable tax items.

International income before tax decreased from $21.0 billion in 2023 to $19.5 billion in 2024. This $1.6 billion decrease in income was primarily driven by lower downstream margins, lower upstream realizations, higher operating expenses and lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts. The increase of $1.5 billion in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $6.4 billion in 2023 to $7.9 billion in 2024, was primarily driven by the tax impacts of the asset sales in Canada, partially offset by the decrease in income before tax.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash The strength of the company’s balance sheet enables it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows. 

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Total balances were $6.8 billion and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The company holds its cash with a diverse group of major financial institutions and has processes and safeguards in place designed to manage its cash balances and mitigate the risk of loss. Cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $31.5 billion, compared to $35.6 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower earnings and higher payments related to asset retirement obligations. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $844 million in 2024 and $1.1 billion in 2023. Capital expenditures totaled $16.4 billion in 2024 compared to $15.8 billion in 2023. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and return of investments totaled $7.7 billion in 2024 compared to $669 million in 2023 primarily related to proceeds from asset sales in Canada. Cash flow from financing activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock options of $330 million in 2024, compared with $261 million in 2023. 

Restricted cash of $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges. The increase of restricted cash in 2024 is mainly due to increase in funds for tax-deferred exchanges.

Dividends Dividends paid to common stockholders were $11.8 billion in 2024 and $11.3 billion in 2023. 

Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $24.5 billion at December 31, 2024, up from $20.8 billion at year-end 2023 as the company issued commercial paper and tax-exempt bonds and retired public bonds. 

The $3.7 billion increase in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2024 was primarily due to the issuance of commercial paper. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $12.7 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $5.1 billion at year-end 2023. Of these amounts, $8.3 billion and $4.5 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2024 and 2023, respectively, since settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to continue refinancing them. 

The company has access to a commercial paper program as a financing source for working capital or other short-term needs. The company had $5.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and there was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2023.

The company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in November 2027 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA).

The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble), and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. 

The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, acquisitions, investments, lending commitments to affiliates and cash returned to shareholders. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the ability to modify its capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program. This provides the flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.

Committed Credit Facilities Information related to committed credit facilities is included in Note 19 Short-Term Debt. 

Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries CUSA issued bonds that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together, the “Obligor Group”). The tables below contain summary financial information for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis, and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded. In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Obligor Group recognized an increase in “Net income (loss)” and reduction in “Current liability - related party” and “Total net equity (deficit)” following the resolution of outstanding balances with subsidiaries outside of the Obligor Group.

Common Stock Repurchase Program On January 25, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of the company’s shares of common stock in an aggregate amount of $75 billion (the “2023 Program”). The 2023 Program took effect on April 1, 2023, and does not have a fixed expiration date. During 2024, the company purchased a total of 100.4 million shares for $15.2 billion and paid an additional $145 million in excise taxes related to 2023 buybacks. As of December 31, 2024, the company had purchased a total of 170.9 million shares for $26.4 billion excluding excise taxes, resulting in $48.6 billion remaining under the 2023 Program. 

Repurchases of shares of the company’s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures (Capex) primarily includes additions to fixed asset or investment accounts for the company’s consolidated subsidiaries and is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Capex by business segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

Capex for 2024 was $16.4 billion, 4 percent higher than 2023 due to higher investments in the upstream.

The company estimates that 2025 Capex will range from $14.5 to $15.5 billion. Upstream Capex is projected at $13 billion, with two-thirds in the United States. This includes $4.5 to $5 billion for Permian Basin development, with the remaining split between the DJ Basin and the Gulf of America. In international Upstream, about $1 billion is allocated to Australia. Downstream Capex is estimated at $1.2 billion, with two-thirds in the United States. About $1.5 billion of total Capex, which is included within upstream and downstream budgets, is dedicated to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and growing new energies businesses. Corporate and other Capex is projected to be about $0.7 billion.

Affiliate Capital Expenditures Equity affiliate capital expenditures (Affiliate Capex) primarily includes additions to fixed asset and investment accounts in the equity affiliate companies’ financial statements and does not require cash outlays by the company. 

Affiliate Capex by business segment for 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

Affiliate Capex for 2024 was $2.4 billion, 31 percent lower than 2023 mainly due to lower spend at Tengizchevroil’s Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP). 

Affiliate Capex is expected to range between $1.7 to $2.0 billion in 2025. Less than half of Affiliate Capex is for Tengizchevroil, while the remaining spend primarily supports CPChem’s two major integrated polymer projects.

The company monitors market conditions and can adjust future capital outlays should conditions change. 

Noncontrolling Interests The company had noncontrolling interests of $839 million at December 31, 2024, and $972 million at December 31, 2023. Distributions to noncontrolling interests net of contributions totaled $195 million and $40 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Financial Ratios and Metrics

The following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time:

Current Ratio Current assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods is adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2024, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $6.0 billion.

Financial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk

The market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations| Financial Table of Contents  

Derivative Commodity Instruments Chevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, NGLs, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, NGLs, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2024. 

The company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors. 

Derivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2024 was not material to the company’s results of operations. 

The company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations. 

Foreign Currency The company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2024.

Interest Rates The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2024, the company had no interest rate swaps. 

Transactions With Related Parties

Chevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in Note 15 Investments and Advances for further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party. 

Litigation and Other Contingencies

Climate Change Information related to climate change-related matters is included in Note 16 Litigation under the heading “Climate Change.” 

Louisiana Information related to Louisiana coastal matters is included in Note 16 Litigation under the heading “Louisiana.” 

Environmental The following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws.

The company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $12.7 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2024 is related primarily to upstream properties.

For the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.

The company records decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets when it is probable that the decommissioning obligations would revert to the Company and costs can be reasonably estimated. At the end of 2024, the liability balance was $2.5 billion. Refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments for additional discussion of decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets.

Income Taxes Information related to income tax contingencies is included in Note 17 Taxes and in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Income Taxes.”

Other Contingencies Information related to other contingencies is included in Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Other Contingencies.” 

Environmental Matters 

The company is subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. Consideration of environmental issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many jurisdictions where we operate. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Business Environment and Outlook on pages 35 through 37 for a discussion of legislative and regulatory efforts to address climate change. 

Most of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.

Accidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards. 

Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2024 at approximately $2.5 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.6 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.9 billion of costs associated

with the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites.

For 2025, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.6 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 

Management makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. 

The discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the SEC, wherein: 

1.the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and

2.the impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.

The development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows: 

Oil and Gas Reserves Crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. 

The estimates of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:

1.Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2024, Chevron’s UOP DD&A for oil and gas properties was $13.0 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2024 were 6.8 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2024 would have increased by approximately $700 million. 

2.Impairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates below.

Refer to Table V, “Proved Reserve Quantity Information,” for the changes in proved reserve estimates for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, and to Table VII, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations| Financial Table of Contents  

This Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.

Impairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates The company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value. 

Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in Note 18 Properties, Plant and Equipment and to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

The company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil, NGLs or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values.

Investments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable. 

A sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.

Asset Retirement Obligations In the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2024 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.

Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans includes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations| Financial Table of Contents  

The determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control.

For 2024, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.0 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 5.0 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 4.8 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2024 was 3.6 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2024, actual asset returns averaged 4.9 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of four years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 7.0 percent during each year.

Total pension expense for 2024 was $551 million. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a one percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 63 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2024 by approximately $84 million. A one percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2024 by approximately $106 million. 

The aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2024, was a net liability of approximately $0.8 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2024, the company used a discount rate of 5.7 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 66 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $261 million, and would have increased the plan’s surplus from $573 million to $834 million. 

For the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2024 was $91 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2024, was $1.9 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 5.1 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 4.9 percent to measure expense in 2024, and a 5.6 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2024. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2024 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2024.

Differences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 95 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the $3.2 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2024. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 98 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.” 

Contingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters, transferred liabilities from previously divested assets, and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. The costs for decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets can also vary from estimates. Recording of liabilities for such costs typically requires judgment to assess the likelihood of decommissioning obligations reverting to the company, the timing of decommissioning activity, regulatory requirements and the scope of decommissioning activities. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology. 

Under the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses,” “Selling, general and administrative expenses” or “Other income (loss)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is more likely than not (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading “Income Taxes.”

Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2024. 

An estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. For further information, refer to “Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period” in Item 1A. Risk Factors, on page 27.

| To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Chevron Corporation|   
| Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting|   
| We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).|   
| In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.|   
| |   
| Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. |

| Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.|   
| The Impact of Proved Developed Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, NetAs described in Notes 1 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s upstream property, plant and equipment, net balance was $129.1 billion as of December 31, 2024, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $15.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company’s estimated volumes of proved crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company’s earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as “management’s specialists”).The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimates of proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. The work of management’s specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves. As a basis for using this work, the specialists’ qualifications were understood and the Company’s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists’ findings related to estimated future production volumes by comparing the estimate to relevant historical and current period information, as applicable.|

Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General The company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Prior years’ data have been reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2024 presentation basis.

Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method. 

Investments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value. 

Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.

Noncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.

Fair Value Measurements The three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.

Derivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.

Inventories Crude oil, products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value.

Properties, Plant and Equipment The successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to Note 21 Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells for additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs. 

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast or carbon costs), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more likely than not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense. 

Long-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to Note 9 Fair Value Measurements relating to fair value measurements.

The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations relating to AROs. 

Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed. 

The capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets. 

Gains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.” 

Expenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.

Leases Leases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated right-of-use assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components.

Where leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes 100 percent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is

reasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.

Decommissioning Obligations from Previously Divested Assets Some assets are divested with their related liabilities, including decommissioning obligations, to a buyer that results in de-recognition of the liability from the balance sheet. In certain instances, such transferred obligations may return to the company and result in losses. To the extent the current owners of the company’s previously divested assets default on their decommissioning obligations, regulators may require that Chevron assume such obligations. The company would accrue losses associated with these obligations when management determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. This typically requires judgment to assess the likelihood of decommissioning obligations reverting to the company, the timing of decommissioning activity, regulatory requirements and the scope of decommissioning activities. For more information on decommissioning obligations related to previously divested assets, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments.

Goodwill Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.

Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized. 

Liabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the company’s AROs. 

For U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.

Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.

Revenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, NGLs, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within 30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized. 

Revenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome. 

Discounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods. 

Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options and certain restricted stock units, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in

New Accounting Standards

Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures The company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2023-07 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The standard requires companies to disclose significant segment expenses. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. For additional information, refer to Note 14 Operating Segments and Geographic Data.

Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The standard requires companies to disclose specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation table and the amount of income taxes paid per major jurisdiction. The company does not expect the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and continues to evaluate disclosure presentation alternatives.

Income Statement (Topic 220) Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The standard requires companies to disclose disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items. The company does not expect the standard to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements and has begun evaluating disclosure presentation alternatives.

Lease Commitments

The company enters into leasing arrangements as a lessee; any lessor arrangements are not significant. Operating lease arrangements mainly involve land, bareboat charters, terminals, drill ships, drilling rigs, time chartered vessels, office buildings and warehouses, and exploration and production equipment. Finance leases primarily include facilities, vessels and office buildings.

Fair Value Measurements 

Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2024. 

Derivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, if applicable. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. 

Properties, Plant and Equipment In 2024, the company did not have any individually material impairments of long lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. In 2023, the company impaired a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, primarily in California, due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state that have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans.

Investments and Advances The company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in 2024 or 2023. 

The tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

At year-end 2024, the company had assets measured at fair value Level 3 using unobservable inputs of $324. The carrying value of these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from discounted cash flow models. Cash flows were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.

Assets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $6,781 and $8,178 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2024. 

“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $1,481 and $1,097 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds mainly related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, a tax-deferred transaction and financing programs. 

Long-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $10,810 and $14,612 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, had estimated fair values of $9,791 and $13,709, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. At December 31, 2024, the fair value of corporate bonds is $9,243 and classified as Level 1 and the fair value of other long-term debt classified as Level 2 is $548.

The carrying values of other short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, were not material.

Note 10 

Financial and Derivative Instruments

Derivative Commodity Instruments The company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. The company applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk associated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.

The company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required. 

Derivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows:

The amount reclassified from AOCL to “Sales and other operating revenues” from designated hedges was a net loss of $25 in 2024, compared with a net loss of $33 in the prior year. At December 31, 2024, before-tax deferred losses in AOCL related to outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $17, all of which is expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings. 

The table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

| | | | | | | | | |   

Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Accounts and notes receivable,” “Long-term receivables,” “Accounts payable,” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations.” Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”

Concentrations of Credit Risk The company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments. For a discussion of credit risk on trade receivables, see Note 28 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.

Note 11

Assets Held for Sale

At December 31, 2024, the company classified $481 of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream and downstream operations that were sold in early 2025, or are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2024 were not material.

Operating Segments and Geographic Data

Although each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with LNG; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities. 

The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM), which is comprised of the company’s Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.

The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).

Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.

Segment Expenses Purchased crude oil and products, operating and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, and depreciation, depletion and amortization are the company’s significant segment expenses. Operating and SG&A expenses include transportation, employee costs, service and fees, fuel and utilities, materials and supplies, SG&A expenses and other components of periodic benefit costs. Other costs and deductions primarily represent taxes other than on income, exploration expense and interest and debt expenses.

Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non-billable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.”

Descriptions of major equity affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows: 

Tengizchevroil Chevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in TCO, which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2024, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $73 higher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and Future Growth Project (FGP) with a principal balance of $4,500. 

Caspian Pipeline Consortium Chevron has a 15 percent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.

Angola LNG Limited Chevron has a 36.4 percent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets. 

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC Chevron owns 50 percent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. Included in the investment balance is a loan with a principal balance of $669 to fund a portion of the Golden Triangle Polymers Project in Orange, Texas, in which Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC owns 51 percent.

GS Caltex Corporation Chevron owns 50 percent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, produces and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants. 

Other Information “Sales and other operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $13,850, $13,623 and $16,286 with affiliated companies for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. “Purchased crude oil and products” includes $6,547, $7,404 and $10,171 with affiliated companies for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

“Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $1,258 and $1,480 due from affiliated companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. “Accounts payable” includes $556 and $591 due to affiliated companies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The following table provides summarized financial information on a 100 percent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevron’s total share, which includes Chevron’s net loans to affiliates of $4,731, $4,494 and $4,278 at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Note 16

Litigation

Climate Change

Governmental and other plaintiffs in various jurisdictions across the United States have brought legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron entities, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Chevron entities are or were among the codefendants in 32 separate lawsuits filed by various U.S. cities and counties, four U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, two Native American tribes, and a trade group in both federal and state courts.3 The lawsuits have asserted various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, unjust enrichment, violations of consumer and environmental protection statutes, violations of unfair competition statutes, violations of a federal antitrust statute, and violations of federal and state RICO statutes, based upon, among other things, the company’s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. Further such proceedings are likely to be brought by other parties. While defendants have sought to remove cases filed in state court to federal court, most of those cases have been remanded to state court and the U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for writ of certiorari on jurisdictional questions to date. The U.S. Supreme Court has also denied petitions for certiorari to review a decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court allowing claims brought by the City and County of Honolulu to proceed past the pleadings. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings include claims for damages (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement, contribution to abatement funds, disgorgement of profits and equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits. Due to the unprecedented nature of the suits, the company is unable to estimate any range of possible liability, but given the uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the cases will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.

3 The cases are: Municipality of Bayamon et al. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., et al., No. 22-cv-1550 (D.P.R.); City of Annapolis v. BP P.L.C., et al., No. C-02-CV-21-000250 (Md. Cir. Ct.)

Louisiana 

Seven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in 37 of these cases.4 The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Further such proceedings may be brought by other parties. The Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari on jurisdictional questions impacting certain of these cases, and those cases have been or will be remanded to Louisiana state court, one of which has been set for trial and is scheduled to begin in March 2025. Federal jurisdictional questions are still being decided for the remaining cases in the United States federal court system. Due to the unprecedented nature of the suits, the company is unable to estimate any range of possible liability, but given the uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the cases will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.

2 Includes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in valuation allowances (2024 - $(12); 2023 - $(84); 2022 - $(36)).

3 The company’s effective tax rate is reflective of equity income reported on an after-tax basis as part of the “Total Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense,” in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Chevron’s share of its equity affiliates’ total income tax expense in 2024 was $1,286.

The 2024 increase in income tax expense of $1,584 and the change in the company’s effective tax rate from 27.6 percent in 2023 to 35.5 percent in 2024 were primarily a result of the tax impacts from the asset sales in Canada.

The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis. The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:

Other accrued liabilities| (1,137)| | | | (1,416)|

Total deferred tax assets| (31,594)| | | | (30,321)|   
Deferred tax assets valuation allowance| 21,313 | | | | 20,416 |   
Total deferred income taxes, net| $| 15,621 | | | | $| 14,661 |   

Deferred tax liabilities increased by $1,336 from year-end 2023, driven by deferred tax impacts resulting from the asset sales in Canada and foreign exchange impacts. Deferred tax assets increased by $1,273 from year-end 2023. This increase was primarily related to increases in foreign tax credits and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by decreases in tax loss carryforwards and other accrued liabilities.

The overall valuation allowance, which increased by $897 from year-end 2023, relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2024, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $9,231 and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $288, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2025 through 2043. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $15,261 will expire between 2025 and 2034.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| At December 31  
| 2024| | | 2023  
Deferred charges and other assets| $| (3,516)| | | | $| (4,169)|   
Noncurrent deferred income taxes| 19,137 | | | | 18,830 |   
Total deferred income taxes, net| $| 15,621 | | | | $| 14,661 |   

Income taxes, including U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes, are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely, or where no taxable temporary differences exist that are attributable to an investment in a foreign entity. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

Uncertain Income Tax Positions The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the

differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.

| | | | | |   
Balance at December 31| $| 4,852 | | | | $| 5,452 | | | $| 5,323 |   

Approximately 76 percent of the $4,852 of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition. 

The company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxation and audits throughout the world. With certain exceptions, income tax examinations are completed through 2016 for the United States and 2007 for other major jurisdictions.

The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. Of the amount of unrecognized tax benefits the company has identified as of December 31, 2024, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in decreases of approximately 68 percent within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.

On the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income Tax Expense (Benefit).” As of December 31, 2024, accrued expense of $268 for anticipated interest and penalties was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accrued expense of $229 as of year-end 2023. Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $40, $124 and $152 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date. 

The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2024, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt. 

At December 31, 2024, the company had $8,250 in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations. The credit facilities allow the company the option to convert outstanding short-term obligations into a term loan for a period of up to one year from the facilities termination date. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under these facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2024. 

The company classified $8,250 and $4,543 of short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to continue refinancing them.

Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells

The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2024:

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2024| 2023| 2022

Ending balance at December 31| $| 1,662 | | $| 1,648 | | $| 1,627 |   

The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling: 

| | | | | | | | | | |

Number of projects with exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year*| 14 | | 13 | | 12 |   

*Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.

Of the $1,645 of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2024, $847 is related to seven projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $798 balance is related to seven projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.

The projects for the $798 referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $383 (five projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within four years; (b) $415 (two projects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all 14 projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. Approximately half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next five years. 

The $1,645 of suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2024, represents 75 exploratory wells in 14 projects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:

Cash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $356, $263 and $5,835, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $24, $20 and $216 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Cash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $395, $566 and $556 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

On May 25, 2022, stockholders approved the Chevron 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2022 LTIP). Awards under the 2022 LTIP may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and non-stock grants. From May 2022 through May 2032, no more than 104 million shares may be issued under the 2022 LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 25, 2022, no more than 48 million of those shares may be issued in the form of full value awards such as share-settled restricted stock, share-settled restricted stock units, share-settled performance shares and other share-settled awards that do not require full payment in cash or property for shares underlying such awards by the award recipient. Contractual terms of equity awards vary between three years for the performance shares and special restricted stock units with cliff vesting at the end of the contractual period, five years for standard restricted stock units with cliff vesting at the end of the contractual period and 10 years for the stock options and stock appreciation rights with graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests around each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. Commencing for grants issued in January 2023 and after, standard restricted stock units vest ratably on an annual basis over a three-year period. Forfeitures of performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures of stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.

Fair Value and Assumptions The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Exercisable at December 31, 2024| 18,372 | | | $| 114.15 | | | 4.15| | $| 675 |   

The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $190, $167 and $2,369, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards. 

As of December 31, 2024, there was $320 of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.

At January 1, 2024, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to 4,419,310 shares. During 2024, 1,525,452 performance shares were granted, 1,966,923 shares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and 118,400 shares were forfeited. At December 31, 2024, there were 3,859,439 performance shares outstanding, of which 2,815,575 are payable in cash and 1,043,864 are payable in shares. The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments payable in cash was $307 and was measured largely using the Monte Carlo simulation method.

At December 31, 2024, there were 5,399,798 restricted stock units outstanding, of which 3,346,557 are payable in cash and 2,053,241 are payable in shares. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments payable in cash was $387, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2024. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under the LTIP totaled 535,122 equivalent shares as of December 31, 2024. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $23.

Note 23

Employee Benefit Plans

The company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives. 

The company also sponsors other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company. 

The company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2024 and 2023 follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the decrease in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial gains caused by higher discount rates used to value the obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations.

Amounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans were $3,376 and $3,792 at the end of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts consisted of:

Assumptions The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:

Expected Return on Plan Assets The company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2024, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.0 percent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for 73 percent of the company’s pension plan assets at the beginning of the year.

The market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the three months preceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the three-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense. 

Discount Rate The discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis were 5.7 percent, 5.0 percent, and 5.2 percent for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, for the main U.S. pension plan and 5.6 percent, 5.0 percent, and 5.2 percent for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, for the main U.S. OPEB plans.

Other Benefit Assumptions For the measurement of accumulated post-employment benefit obligation at December 31, 2024, for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with 8.4 percent in 2025 and gradually decline to 4.5 percent for 2034 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2023, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with 8.4 percent in 2024 and gradually declined to 4.5 percent for 2033 and beyond.

The primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.

The company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise 95 percent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established. 

For the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities 30–60 percent, Fixed Income 30–50 percent, Real Estate 5–25 percent, Alternative Investments 0–5 percent and Cash 0–15 percent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities 5–15 percent, Fixed Income 63–93 percent, Real Estate 5–15 percent, and Cash 0–7 percent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and liquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds. 

The company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.

Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments In 2024, the company contributed $754 and $90 to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2025, the company expects contributions to be approximately $750 to its U.S. plans and $100 to its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations. 

The company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $150 in 2025; $148 was paid in 2024. 

The following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years:

Benefit Plan Trusts Prior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2024, the trust contained 14.2 million shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations. 

Employee Incentive Plans The Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $965, $809 and $1,169 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in Note 22 Stock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation.

Note 24

Other Contingencies and Commitments

Income Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 17 Taxes for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. 

Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.

Guarantees The company has one guarantee to an equity affiliate totaling $98. This guarantee is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate 3-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for this guarantee.

Indemnifications The company often includes standard indemnification provisions in its arrangements with its partners, suppliers and vendors in the ordinary course of business, the terms of which range in duration and sometimes are not limited. The company may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with its service or other claims made against such parties. 

Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate amounts of required payments under throughput and take-or-pay agreements are: 2025 – $1,039; 2026 – $1,129; 2027 – $1,304; 2028 – $1,326; 2029 – $1,236; after 2029 – $6,882. The aggregate amount of required payments for other unconditional purchase obligations are: 2025 – $436; 2026 – $653; 2027 – $477; 2028 – $380; 2029 – $186; after 2029 – $907. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were $1,354 in 2024, $1,420 in 2023 and $1,866 in 2022. 

Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields and mining sites.

Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity. 

Chevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2024, was $945. Included in this balance was $220 related to remediation activities at sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the U.S. federal Superfund law which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. 

Of the remaining year-end 2024 environmental reserves balance of $725, $440 is related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, $49 to its international downstream operations, and $236 to its upstream operations. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both. 

The company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2024 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. 

Refer to Note 25 Asset Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.

Decommissioning Obligations for Previously Divested Assets Some assets are divested along with their related liabilities, such as decommissioning obligations. In certain instances, such transferred obligations have returned and may continue to return to the company. For example, in fourth quarter 2023, the company recognized charges for decommissioning obligations from certain previously divested assets in the Gulf of America. To the extent the current owners of the company’s previously divested assets default on their decommissioning obligations, regulators may require that Chevron assume such obligations. The company could have additional significant obligations revert, primarily in the United States. The company is not currently aware of any such obligations that are reasonably possible to be material. The liability balance at the end of 2023 was $2,708, $235 was spent in 2024, and the balance at the end of 2024 was $2,478. 

Other Contingencies The company and its affiliates continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. 

Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.

Note 25

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. The ARO liability is initially recognized at its fair value with an increase to the related asset. Subsequent accretion of the liability and depreciation of the asset is recorded over time. The company evaluates its ARO estimates regularly or when there is significant new information about costs, timing, and duration of asset retirement activity.

AROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation. 

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2024, 2023 and 2022:

| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2024| | | 2023| | 2022

Balance at December 31| $| 12,667 | | | | $| 13,833 | | | $| 12,701 |   

In the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” primarily reflects increased cost estimates and scope changes to decommission wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $12,667 balance at the end of 2024 was $11,429.

Note 26

Revenue 

Revenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenues” along with some activity that is accounted for outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 14 Operating Segments and Geographic Data for additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue. 

Receivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $14,227 and $13,641 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606. 

Contract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in “Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for these items are not material to the company’s financial position.

Note 27

Other Financial Information 

Earnings in 2024 included after-tax gains of approximately $246 relating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount, approximately $231 and $15 related to upstream and downstream, respectively. Earnings in 2023 included after-tax gains of approximately $143 relating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $110 and $33 related to upstream and downstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2022 included after-tax gains of approximately $390 relating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $300 and $90 related to upstream and downstream assets, respectively. 

Earnings in 2024 included after-tax charges of approximately $715 for severance ($208 in All Other, $188 in U.S. Downstream, $183 in U.S. Upstream, $119 in International Upstream, $17 in International Downstream) and $400 for impairments ($185 in International Downstream, $125 in International Upstream, $90 in U.S. Downstream). Earnings in 2023 included after-tax charges of approximately $1,950 for decommissioning obligations from previously divested oil and gas production assets in the U.S. Upstream Gulf of America, $1,765 for U.S. Upstream impairments, mainly in California, and several tax items with a net benefit of $655 in International Upstream. Earnings in 2022 included after-tax charges of approximately $1,075 for impairments and other asset write-offs related to International Upstream, $600 for an early contract termination in U.S. Upstream, and $271 for pension settlement costs in All Other.

The company has $4,578 in goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, of which $4,226 is in the upstream segment primarily related to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal and $352 is in the downstream segment related to the 2022 acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Inc. The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2024, and no impairment was required.

Note 28

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

Chevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $611 and $641 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances. 

The majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $18,338 at December 31, 2024, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.

Chevron’s non-trade receivable balance was $3,835 at December 31, 2024, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Loans to equity affiliates and non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of zero and $219 at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included within “Investments and advances” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc.

On August 7, 2023, the company acquired PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC), an independent exploration and production company with operations in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado and the Delaware Basin in west Texas.

The aggregate purchase price of PDC was $6,520, with approximately 41 million shares of Chevron common stock issued as consideration in the transaction. The shares represented approximately two percent of the shares of Chevron common stock outstanding immediately after the transaction closed on August 7, 2023.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair value. Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together with appropriate operating cost and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices for PDC’s debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value, there was no goodwill or bargain purchase recognized.

The following table summarizes the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

| | | | | | | | | | |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| | | At August 7, 2023  
Current assets| | | $| 630 |

Purchase Price| | | $| 6,520 |   

Pro forma financial information is not disclosed as the acquisition was deemed not to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations.

Agreement to Acquire Hess Corporation

On October 23, 2023, Chevron Corporation announced it had entered into a definitive agreement with Hess Corporation (Hess) to acquire all of its outstanding shares in an all-stock transaction, valued at approximately $53,000, pursuant to which Hess stockholders will receive 1.0250 shares of Chevron common stock for each Hess share. The transaction was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.

On May 28, 2024, a majority of Hess stockholders voted to approve the merger. Following the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) review of the transaction, on September 30, 2024, the FTC announced that a majority of the Commission voted to accept a consent agreement among the FTC, Chevron and Hess, resolving the concerns the FTC identified during its review of the transaction. Chevron and Hess have taken and will continue to take appropriate steps to maintain our ability to close the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended. The filing of an arbitration relating to the right of first refusal contained in the Stabroek Block operating agreement among Hess Guyana Exploration Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hess, and affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation has delayed completion of the transaction. An arbitration decision against Hess Guyana and in favor of Exxon Guyana and CNOOC Guyana would cause the transaction not to be completed. The arbitration merits hearing has been scheduled for May 2025, with a decision expected in approximately the following three months. 

Chevron and Hess are working to complete the merger as soon as practicable. However, neither Chevron nor Hess can predict the actual date on which the transaction will be completed, if at all, because it is subject to conditions beyond each company’s control. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the Hess acquisition.

* Reserve quantities include natural gas projected to be consumed in operations of 2,462, 2,655 and 2,737 billions of cubic feet and equivalent synthetic oil projected to be consumed in operations of 0, 27, and 28 millions of barrels as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Reserves Governance The company has adopted a comprehensive reserves and resources classification system modeled after a system developed and approved by a number of organizations, including the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.

Proved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.

Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Proved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the business units that estimate reserves. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 35 years of experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

All RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.

The RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the business units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve quantities are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual, which provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.

During the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserves activity is also reviewed with the company’s Audit Committee and Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.

RAC sub-teams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the Chevron Corporation Reserves Manual. 

Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions In 2024, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.

In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance. 

In 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the Gulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.

In 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC. 

The difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024. 

Transfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the Gulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG. A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities. 

During 2024, the company’s investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the Gulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of expenditures. The company’s equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan. 

Reserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.

At year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints. 

Annually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.

Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.

At December 31, 2024, proved reserves for the company were 9.8 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids, including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.

Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:

Revisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan. 

In 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities led to a decrease of 58 million barrels in California. In Other Americas, entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 42 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.

In 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.

Extensions and Discoveries In 2022, extensions and discoveries in the Midland, Delaware and DJ basins, and approval of the Ballymore Project in the Gulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada. 

In 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.

In 2024, extensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.

Purchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The extension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.

In 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.

In 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels. 

Sales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.

Noteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:

Revisions In 2022, the performance of the Leviathan and Tamar fields in Israel and the Bibiyana and Jalalabad fields in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for the 1.8 TCF increase in Asia. In Australia, the 377 BCF decrease was mainly due to updated reservoir characterization of the Wheatstone field. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 285 BCF decrease.

In 2023, portfolio optimization decrease of 276 BCF and a reservoir performance decrease of 186 BCF in the Midland and Delaware basins along with a reduction in planned development activities leading to a decrease of 485 BCF in the Haynesville shale formation of east Texas, were mainly responsible for the 1.2 TCF decrease in the United States. In Asia, final investment decision on a new gas pipeline project in Israel and reservoir performance in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for the 481 BCF increase.

In 2024, a decrease of 425 BCF in the DJ basin, primarily related to reservoir performance, was mainly responsible for the 572 BCF decrease in the United States. The 504 BCF increase in Australia was mainly due to reservoir performance of the Jansz Io field.

Extensions and Discoveries In 2022, extensions and discoveries of 1.6 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.

In 2023, extensions and discoveries of 660 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.

In 2024, extensions and discoveries of 912 BCF in the United States were primarily in the DJ basin with 476 BCF, and the Midland and Delaware basins with 432 BCF.

Purchases In 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ basin was primarily responsible for the 2.2 TCF in the United States.

In 2024, the 177 BCF in the United States was primarily associated with the acquisition of PDC in the DJ basin.

Sales In 2022, sales of 243 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Eagle Ford shale and Midland and Delaware basins.

In 2024, sales of 260 BCF in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.

Table VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves 

The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs, which could change over time as new information becomes available. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.
