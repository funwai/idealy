Part I

Item 1. Business Description

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing, services and retailing activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.

Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations and Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations participate in and are ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses.

Berkshire’s senior corporate management is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for selecting an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with government laws and regulations and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees.

Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and its operating subsidiaries employed approximately 392,400 people worldwide at the end of 2024, of which approximately 80% were in the United States (“U.S.”) and 20% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations. Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries each establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within their organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature and size of business activities, specific policies and practices vary among Berkshire’s operating subsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation, which includes various health insurance and retirement benefits, as well as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates. Berkshire’s combined U.S. workforce data, based on U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, is available on its website (https://www.berkshirehathaway.com), under sustainability.

Insurance Businesses

Berkshire’s insurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks as well as life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance businesses employed approximately 41,500 people at the end of 2024. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers.

In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from people or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.

Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.

Insurers based in the U.S. are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of state regulation is to monitor financial solvency of insurers and otherwise protect policyholder interests. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities and have the authority to suspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business. States regulate the payment of shareholder dividends by insurance companies and other transactions with affiliates.

K-1

* * *

Insurers that market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and/or premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts.

The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. In addition, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs dealing with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these solvency and soundness related matters, and the laws and regulations implemented in individual states may differ from those adopted by the NAIC.

International insurance regulators, through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), have been developing advisory standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The Insurance Core Principles and ComFrame cover a wide range of topics, including group-wide supervision by regulators, corporate governance, risk management, capital adequacy and other macroprudential issues. As part of ComFrame, the IAIS adopted an international capital standard (“ICS”) for internationally active insurance groups in December 2024.

While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, U.S. state insurance departments and the NAIC are implementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic and international insurance regulators. U.S. state regulators require insurance groups to file an annual report and an Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAIC also adopted a group capital calculation (“GCC”) tool for large insurance groups. The NAIC’s GCC is a tool designed to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the future. While the ICS is based on a consolidation approach, the GCC is based on an aggregation approach called the Aggregation Method. In December 2024, the IAIS announced that the Aggregation Method has been deemed to be comparable to the ICS.

The Nebraska Department of Insurance (“Nebraska DOI”) acts as the lead supervisor for Berkshire’s insurance group and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. The Nebraska DOI adopted the GCC tool, and Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries are required to submit an annual GCC to it.

Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. The combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $310 billion at December 31, 2024. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a Terrorism Insurance Program (“Program”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury to provide federal reinsurance of certified terrorism losses incurred by U.S. commercial property and casualty insurers. The Program extends to December 31, 2027 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for certifying acts of terrorism under TRIA. Federal reinsurance under TRIA may apply if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million.

To be eligible for reinsurance under TRIA, insurers must make insurance coverage available for acts of terrorism by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for the coverage and the federal share of insured losses resulting from an act of terrorism. TRIA excludes certain forms of direct insurance, such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines. Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses.

In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of the insurers group deductible. Under TRIA, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible for Berkshire’s insurance group is expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2025. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of the federal reinsurance coverage for each TRIA year.

The extent of insurance regulation varies widely among the countries where Berkshire’s non-U.S. operations conduct business. Each country imposes licensing, solvency, risk management and financial reporting requirements, although the type and extent of the requirements may differ substantially by jurisdiction.

Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local non-U.S. regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators maintain close relationships with subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.

Berkshire’s non-U.S. insurance operations are conducted through subsidiaries and branches of subsidiaries. Non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries are primarily located in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Australia and South Africa, and branches are also maintained in several other countries. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements involve discretionary licensing procedures, risk management and governance requirements, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection programs. Berkshire’s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions, and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened due to industry and economic developments.

Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), based in New York, New York, was acquired by Berkshire on October 19, 2022. Alleghany’s operating subsidiaries include property and casualty reinsurance and insurance businesses. Alleghany’s primary insurance businesses are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and its reinsurance businesses are included in the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.

Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products, which generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit over time and that its managers will reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less incurred insurance losses and benefits, loss adjustment expenses and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.

GEICO—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries include Government Employees Insurance Company and several other insurance entities. The GEICO insurance subsidiaries’ principal business is the sale of private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO subsidiaries also sell insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial automobile fleets. Marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO also operates an insurance agency that offers insurance written by third parties for individuals desiring insurance coverages that are not sold by GEICO insurance subsidiaries, such as homeowners, renters, condominium, life and identity protection insurance.

GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Progressive, Allstate and USAA. According to the A.M. Best data for 2023 published in 2024, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share of approximately 62.3% based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market share being the third largest at approximately 12.3%.

Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other events and factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims.

GEICO’s insurance policies are written on an admitted basis. State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance policies and rates. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. GEICO’s name and other trademarks are considered material assets and are protected through appropriate registrations.

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group—The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the U.S. Nearly 90% of BH Primary premiums written in 2024 were in the U.S., of which approximately 60% was written on an admitted basis, with the remainder written on a non-admitted basis. These various operations are discussed below.

Insurance coverage is offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers.

Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”) is a group of insurers offering workers’ compensation, commercial automobile and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small-to-large deductible workers’ compensation coverage to employers nationwide. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska.

Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”) offers commercial property and casualty, executive and professional, and various other insurance coverages through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and several other Berkshire subsidiaries. BHSI writes primary and excess policies on an admitted and non-admitted basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BHSI is based in Boston, Massachusetts, and has regional offices in several other cities within the U.S. BHSI also maintains international offices and branches in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and across several countries in Asia and Europe. BHSI writes insurance policies through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as through managing general agents.

Alleghany’s property and casualty insurance business is conducted in the U.S. on both an admitted and non-admitted basis through RSUI Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“RSUI”) and CapSpecialty, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“CapSpecialty”). RSUI and CapSpecialty primarily write specialty insurance in the property, umbrella/excess liability, professional liability, directors’ and officers’ liability and general liability lines of business. Insurance is written through independent wholesale insurance brokers, retail agents and managing general agents.

MedPro Group (“MedPro”) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (“HCL”) insurance in the U.S. MedPro provides customized HCL insurance, as well as claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance solutions to international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, offers professional liability insurance to other non-healthcare professionals, and provides specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire subsidiaries. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. MLMIC Insurance Company (“MLMIC”) writes medical professional liability insurance policies in New York State through brokers and on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. MLMIC is based in Albany, New York.

U.S. Liability Insurance Company (“USLI”) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines of insurance on an admitted basis, as well as on an excess and surplus lines basis. USLI markets policies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI also underwrites and markets a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The GUARD Insurance Companies (“GUARD”) consist of five insurance companies that provide a comprehensive suite of commercial insurance solutions to over 200,000 small-to-medium sized businesses. These insurance products are accessible through independent agents and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

Berkshire Hathaway Direct Insurance Company and its affiliates (“BH Direct”) offer commercial insurance products (including workers’ compensation, property, auto, general and professional liability) to small business customers. BH Direct’s products are primarily sold through two internet-based distribution platforms, biBERK.com and Threeinsurance.com. BH Direct writes policies on an admitted basis and is based in Stamford, Connecticut.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group—Berkshire’s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business is written through NICO and affiliates (“NICO Group”), General Re Corporation and its subsidiaries (“General Re Group”) and Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and its affiliates (“TransRe Group”). U.S. underwriting operations of the NICO Group and General Re Group are based in Stamford, Connecticut while the TransRe Group is based in New York, New York.

Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess-of-loss. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess-of-loss (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or “retention.” Both quota-share and excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.

K-4

* * *

The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions.

Property/casualty

The NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for very large or unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium derived from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (“IAG”). This quota-share agreement expires December 31, 2029. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries.

The General Re Group is a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. The General Re Group conducts business in North America, primarily marketed on a direct basis through General Reinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC also conducts operations in North America through numerous branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.

In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. These companies offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers and their business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators.

The General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is primarily written on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG, based in Cologne, Germany, and subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries, as well as through brokers by Faraday Corporate Capital Limited, which participates in the Lloyd’s of London market through Syndicate 435.

The TransRe Group provides quota-share and excess-of-loss reinsurance across various property and casualty lines of business. Contracts are written on both a treaty and facultative basis to insurance companies in the U.S. and in foreign markets through subsidiaries and branches in numerous countries. Business is written primarily through brokers, and to a lesser extent on a direct basis.

Life/health

The General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In 2024, net premiums written were primarily in the Asia-Pacific, U.S. and Western Europe regions. The General Re Group underwrites life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care risks on a direct basis.

Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”) and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and reinsured certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity risks, which are in run-off.

Retroactive reinsurance

Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies for adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverage under such contracts is provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.

The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which is reflected through investment results in future periods.

K-5

* * *

Periodic payment annuity

BHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront consideration and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation claims of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money is an important factor in establishing annuity premiums and ultimate payments are expected to exceed premiums received, producing underwriting losses. BHLN wrote no new policies in 2023 and 2024 in response to changing economic and market conditions.

Investments of insurance businesses—Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and, to a lesser extent, by two corporate investment managers. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are unusually concentrated in relatively few companies, as well as in short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. Generally, there are no target allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry.

Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance businesses (“float”). Float represents the approximate net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that are held for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities (excluding the effects of discount rate changes that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income), unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $129 billion at the end of 2019 to approximately $171 billion at the end of 2024. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting earnings (or loss) as a percentage of average float.

Burlington Northern Santa Fe

Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 36,500 employees at the end of 2024, of whom approximately 32,000 were members of a labor union.

In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and certain ports of the U.S., BNSF Railway transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels.

BNSF Railway’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and certain ports in the western and southern U.S. as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. Freight revenues are classified into the following categories: consumer products, industrial products, agricultural products and coal. The volumes shipped and rates charged are affected by competition from other freight carriers within the transportation industry, and changes in the underlying supply and demand for such products.

Regulatory Matters

BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.

The DOT, OSHA and EPA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety, health and environmental aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some health, safety and environmental aspects of rail operations in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.

Environmental Matters

BNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.

Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal statutes (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations.

Consumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF Railway’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches, that is anticipated to result in a 30% reduction in BNSF Railway’s GHG emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018. BNSF Railway intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested.

Competition

The business environment in which BNSF Railway operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.

As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the U.S. is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway.

Regulatory Matters

The U.S. utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.6 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.

With certain limited exceptions, the U.S. utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including the opportunity to earn a fair and reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of U.S. utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services.

Northern Powergrid (Northeast) plc and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, the British electricity regulatory body. The current electricity distribution price control runs from April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028.

AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.

The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges, terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas export/import facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities.

Environmental Matters

BHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.

The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. The implementation of these laws and regulations may impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities, including requiring reductions in emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers.

In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and reaching a global peak of GHG emissions as soon as possible to achieve climate neutrality by mid-century; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will be more aggressive in reducing GHG emissions. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement formally became effective on November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG emissions by 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. In December 2024, President Biden released new commitments to reach a 61% to 66% reduction in emissions by 2035 from 2005 levels, which includes a 35% reduction in methane emissions. While in January 2025, President Trump ordered to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the outgoing Biden administration highlighted that the revised targets could be met without federal action. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.

In April 2024, the EPA finalized new rules addressing GHG emissions for the power sector. The requirements are scheduled to take effect January 1, 2030. New natural gas-fueled combustion turbines are expected to utilize lower-emitting fuels and operate as highly efficient generation. Additionally, new baseload combustion turbines exceeding a 40% annual capacity factor must meet an emission limit equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. The EPA also identified carbon capture and sequestration as the technology basis for the emissions standards for coal units. Coal-fueled units that will operate after December 31, 2038, must meet emission limits equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. Other units are anticipated to co-fire with natural gas and retire prior to January 1, 2039, or convert to natural gas operations and meet emission limits corresponding to capacity factors. The EPA deferred action on standards for existing natural gas-fueled combustion turbines. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The incoming Trump administration is expected to ask the court to abate litigation while it reevaluates the rule. Because the rule is final and in effect, additional rulemaking would be required to rescind and potentially replace the emissions standards.

In November 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and natural gas sources and would require states to reduce methane emissions from existing sources nationwide. The EPA issued a supplemental proposal in November 2022 to further strengthen emission requirements. The rule was finalized in December 2023. Affected sources may have up to five years from the rule’s effective date to comply with requirements identified in state implementation plans. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump administration is expected to ask the court to abate litigation while it reevaluates the rule. Because the rule is final and in effect, additional rulemaking would be required to rescind and potentially replace the emissions standards.

BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate its GHG emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation, BHE’s subsidiaries work with their regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability and sources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned renewable generation and storage, with cumulative investments of $35.4 billion through December 31, 2024. Additionally, BHE has ceased coal operations at 18 generation units. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, BHE has reduced its annual GHG emissions by more than 38% as compared to 2005 levels. To the extent it is beneficial for customers and consistent with regulatory provisions, BHE plans to continue investing in renewable and other low-carbon generation and storage in the future and to cease coal operations at additional coal generation units in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.

Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide its customers with advantages, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Nevertheless, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages.

Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum, hafnium and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.

PCC is subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, particularly related to air and water quality and climate change, including reporting of GHG emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters.

Clayton also offers home financing and other financial services and competes on price, service, location and delivery capabilities.

All Clayton Built® off-site built homes are designed, engineered and assembled in the U.S. As of December 2024, off-site backlog was approximately $700 million. Clayton sells off-site built homes through independent and company-owned home centers, realtors and subdivision channels. Clayton considers its ability to offer financing to retail purchasers a factor affecting the marketplace acceptance of its off-site built homes. Clayton’s financing programs utilize proprietary loan underwriting guidelines to evaluate loan applicants.

Clayton’s site-built division, Clayton Properties Group (“CPG”), includes nine builders across 18 states with nearly 300 subdivisions, supplementing the portfolio of housing products offered to customers. CPG owned and controlled approximately 66,000 homesites, with a home order backlog of approximately $1.46 billion as of December 2024.

Access to key housing inputs, including lumber, steel and resin products, was adequate in 2023 and 2024. Historically, the availability and pricing of these and other inputs has been volatile resulting in input shortages.

Clayton’s off-site home building business is impacted by changes in U.S. home mortgage interest rates. While interest rates slightly declined in the latter part of 2024, interest rates significantly increased during 2022 and 2023, slowing demand for new home construction, which was partially mitigated by low supplies of pre-existing homes for sale.

Clayton’s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting and stormwater protection for site-built home subdivisions. The financing business originates and services loans which are federally regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, various state regulatory agencies and reviewed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Government National Mortgage Association and government-sponsored enterprises.

Berkshire Hathaway Automotive

Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”) is one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S., operating 108 new vehicle franchises through 83 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the U.S. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 31 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor.

Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. These manufacturers normally represent approximately 90% of the revenue generated by BHA’s dealerships.

The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the retail price transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers.

BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA.

Individual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.

BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and insurance personnel.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.

General Business Risks

Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.

A nuclear, biological or chemical terrorist attack or armed terrorist incursions could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human life, destruction of production facilities and information systems or other property damage. We share these risks with all businesses.

Cybersecurity risks could result in economic losses to our businesses and reputational damage.

We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.

Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.

Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses.

Geopolitical events could cause losses to our business and losses in the values of securities we own.

We believe risks of adverse effects from geopolitical events are rising, through armed and diplomatic conflicts involving governments in various parts of the world. Government policies and actions taken in the U.S. and elsewhere, including responses of other governments to such actions may adversely affect our operating businesses through reduced sales, increased costs, restricted supply chains, physical damage to our properties and loss of life of our employees and losses in the values of the securities we own. In addition, international trade policies in the U.S. and elsewhere, including tariffs and other barriers, could negatively impact our operating results. We share these risks with all businesses.

We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.

Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 94. Mr. Gregory Abel is Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain is Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett.

If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units, helps to mitigate this risk.

K-24

* * *

We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.

In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel to execute business plans and serve their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit, train and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. Further, labor disruptions or strikes at our subsidiaries, our customers or within our supply chains could reduce our sales, increase our costs and negatively impact our periodic operating results.

Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.

We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of issuers. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings.

Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business, thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits.

Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.

Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline.

Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost.

Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions, including significant inflation over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected.

Epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks could hurt our operating businesses.

The outbreak of epidemics, pandemics or other similar outbreaks in the future may adversely affect our operations, including the value of our equity securities portfolio. This may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.

Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.

Over time, regulatory initiatives have been adopted in the United States and elsewhere for a variety of reasons, including as responses to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues. Such initiatives address, for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, the regulation of products and services and environmental and climate change matters and income tax policy. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have significant, but not controlling, economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.

Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant economic penalties.

K-25

Climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions may impact our businesses.

Climate and weather-related events and the regulation of GHG emissions could impact our businesses to varying degrees. Climate-related events, including hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other extreme weather events may increase the physical risks and impacts to our operations. An increase in the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events and storms could negatively impact the physical assets of our non-insurance operations and could produce losses affecting our businesses. Similarly, extreme weather events may produce losses affecting our insurance operations as their primary business is to monitor, assess and price risk, including climate-related risk, at an expected economic profit to address the risk-transfer needs of their insurance customers.

Additional GHG and climate-related policies, including legislation, may emerge that influence the transition to a lower GHG-emitting economy and could, in turn, influence costs for our businesses to comply with those policies, including BNSF and BHE, which combined represent more than 90% of Berkshire’s direct emissions. The failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretation of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.

Risks unique to our regulated businesses

Our tolerance for underwriting risk assumed in our various insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.

When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses, attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate in excess of $15 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Various provisions of our policies, negotiated to limit our risk, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend, as it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period.

The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be settled. Although we believe that recorded liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. It is possible that significant claims may emerge or develop in the future from the policies we have written in the past.

As industry practices and legal, social and environmental conditions evolve, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge, including new or expanded theories of liability and increased frequency of litigation. These or other changes could impose new financial obligations on us by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent and result in increased litigation costs and adverse judicial awards. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($147.6 billion at December 31, 2024), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in a material reduction in reported earnings.

Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.

Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.

K-26

* * *

Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. BNSF can be exposed to significant litigation costs and losses arising from these matters and from ongoing business operations.

BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a fuel source in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or otherwise displace coal as an energy source, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.

Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding numerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air quality, climate change, emissions performance standards, water quality, coal ash disposal and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Furthermore, our regulated energy subsidiaries are exposed to losses arising from wildfires and related litigation and judicial outcomes. The energy rates charged by our regulated energy subsidiaries to customers are based on the costs of the business and require regulatory approval. To the extent costs are not recoverable through approved rates, the operating results and financial condition of these businesses can be negatively impacted, perhaps materially.

Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. System assets may need to be operational for long periods of time to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity

Berkshire recognizes that maintaining processes for identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity threats is important in dealing with its significant business risks. As such, Berkshire has implemented a framework for cybersecurity and cyber-related information management across Berkshire’s diverse groups of businesses. The framework permits each Berkshire Business Group (“Business Group”) to tailor solutions to identify, manage, and mitigate risks based on their own assessment of their unique cybersecurity risks in conjunction with each Business Group’s overall risk management processes. At the same time, the framework helps enable consistent and appropriate compliance in reporting material cyber events and risks across Berkshire.

Each Business Group’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) on at least an annual basis is to provide a report to the Business Group’s senior management, regarding the state of their cybersecurity program and its material cyber risks. These reports are also shared with Berkshire’s internal audit group to inform and enhance the overall company’s risk management processes. In addition, each Business Group is required to maintain an incident reporting process to report significant cybersecurity events to Berkshire. Berkshire and its Business Groups engage and partner with a wide range of third parties to assess, audit, educate, implement, operate, protect, and remediate various cybersecurity related elements.

K-27

* * *

Berkshire and its Business Groups rely on third-party service providers for a variety of products and services to run their information systems. This dependence exposes Berkshire and the Business Groups, along with others who use these service providers, to the impact of a cyber-attack on their service providers. On occasion, a cyber-attack at a third party service provider could have a significant financial, operational or reputational impact to Berkshire. Berkshire and its Business Groups continuously monitor the risks associated with its service providers.

The Audit Committee of Berkshire’s Board of Directors has responsibility for oversight of Berkshire’s cybersecurity risk management program. The Audit Committee receives periodic reports regarding the number of and impact from cybersecurity incidents reported through Berkshire’s cybersecurity incident reporting process. Additionally, the Audit Committee is updated on cybersecurity trends and related issues. Furthermore, the Audit Committee approves and receives updates on the workplan performed by Berkshire’s internal audit group that focuses on information technology and cybersecurity risks. This includes audit procedures related to internal and external penetration testing, attack simulations, vulnerability assessments, cybersecurity program reviews and other audits designed to investigate specific risks. The frequency of these updates is determined by the Audit Committee in conjunction with Berkshire’s senior management.

In addition to the Audit Committee’s oversight, the senior management of Berkshire’s Businesses Groups are responsible for the day-to-day operations of protecting their businesses’ information systems. Each Business Group is required to report significant cybersecurity events to Berkshire. Berkshire’s senior management reviews incident reports to determine whether a cyber incident report should be filed with the SEC.

Item 2. Description of Properties

The properties used by Berkshire’s business segments are summarized in this section. Berkshire’s railroad and utilities and energy businesses, in particular, utilize considerable physical assets in their businesses.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Reference is made to Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning certain litigation involving Berkshire subsidiaries. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise from other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

Information regarding the Company’s mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

Following is a list of the Registrant’s named executive officers:

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of Berkshire officials during presentations about Berkshire or its subsidiaries are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”). Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements.

Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, geopolitical conflict, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, and other events that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.

Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. The business segment data (Note 26 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be referenced in conjunction with this discussion.

Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods due to impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these factors or events on our businesses.

Insurance underwriting generated after-tax earnings of $9.0 billion in 2024 and $5.4 billion in 2023 and losses of $30 million in 2022. Earnings in 2024 and 2023 benefited from significantly improved operating results at GEICO, which generated a significant loss in 2022. Underwriting results in 2024 also included estimated claims from Hurricanes Helene and Milton ($1.2 billion after-tax) and accruals in connection with a bankruptcy settlement agreement related to a non-insurance affiliate. Underwriting results in 2023 and 2022 included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $725 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $4.1 billion in 2024 and $3.1 billion in 2023 compared to corresponding prior years, driven by higher interest income from short-term investments.

After-tax earnings of BNSF declined 1.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 and 14.4% in 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in 2024 benefited from higher unit volume, improvements in employee productivity and lower other operating costs, and were negatively impacted by charges related to a labor agreement in the fourth quarter of 2024 and litigation charges related to an ongoing legal case. The decrease in 2023 was primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs.

After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased $1.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 and declined $1.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase in 2024 reflected lower estimated wildfire loss accruals at PacifiCorp and higher earnings from natural gas pipelines, primarily due to reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, and other energy businesses. The earnings decline in 2023 reflected increased estimated wildfire loss accruals, as well as lower earnings from other energy and real estate brokerage businesses compared to 2022.

Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased 2.2% in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 6.8% in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline in 2024 reflected lower earnings from our service and retailing businesses, partially offset by earnings increases at several of our manufacturing businesses. The earnings increase in 2023 reflected increases at certain industrial products manufacturers and service businesses, the full year impact of Alleghany’s non-insurance businesses acquired in 2022 and earnings from Pilot Travel Centers for the eleven months ending December 31, 2023, partially offset by lower earnings at several of our other manufacturing businesses and at certain of our service and retailing businesses.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Results of Operations

Investment gains (losses) predominantly derive from our investments in equity securities and include significant unrealized gains and losses from changes in market prices and foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of our investments. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment gains in 2023 also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4 billion related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method.

Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains of $1.1 billion in 2024, $211 million in 2023 and $1.3 billion in 2022 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).

Insurance—Underwriting

Our periodic underwriting earnings may be subject to considerable volatility from the timing and magnitude of significant property catastrophe loss events. Further, we generally do not retrocede the risks we assume. We currently consider consolidated pre-tax losses exceeding $150 million from an event occurring in the current year to be significant. Significant events in 2024 included Hurricanes Milton and Helene, while significant events in 2023 included a cyclone and floods in New Zealand and a hailstorm in Italy. In 2022, significant events were Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia. In January 2025, several wildfires broke out in Southern California resulting in thousands of destroyed or damaged structures. We preliminarily estimate our insurance group could incur pre-tax losses of approximately $1.3 billion from these wildfires. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results.

We write primary insurance and reinsurance policies covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). We strive to generate pre-tax underwriting earnings (defined as premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except in our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important consideration in establishing premiums for these policies, which we normally receive at the contract inception date. Claim and benefit payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods through changes in deferred charge assets established on retroactive reinsurance contracts and accretion of discounted annuity liabilities, as well as changes in the estimated ultimate liabilities.

Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Insurance—Underwriting

GEICO

GEICO writes property and casualty policies, primarily private passenger automobile insurance, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. GEICO also operates an insurance agency that offers primarily homeowners and renters insurance to its auto policyholders. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) | $ | 7,813 |  |  |  |  |  | $ | 3,635 |  |  |  |  |  | $ | (1,880 | ) |  |  |   

2024 versus 2023

GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings increase in 2024 compared to 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies and improved operating efficiencies. These effects were partially offset by less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates, increases in average claims severities and losses from catastrophe events.

Premiums written increased $3.1 billion (7.7%) in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting an increase in average written premiums per auto policy of 7.8%, primarily attributable to rate increases, partially offset by a 0.5% decrease in policies-in-force over the past year. The rate of decline in policies-in-force slowed in the first half of 2024, with growth experienced in the second half of the year. Premiums earned in 2024 increased $3.0 billion (7.6%) compared to 2023.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $1.5 billion (4.7%) in 2024 compared to 2023. GEICO’s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 71.8% in 2024 and 81.0% in 2023. The loss ratio decline reflected the impact of higher average earned premiums per auto policy and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities and less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates.

Claims frequencies declined in 2024 versus 2023 for property damage (two to three percent range) and collision (eight to nine percent range) coverages, with bodily injury down slightly. Average claims severities increased in 2024 for property damage and collision (two to five percent range) and bodily injury coverages (eight to ten percent range) compared to 2023. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2024 from Hurricanes Helene and Milton were approximately $360 million. Reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims were $550 million in 2024 compared to $1.5 billion in 2023.

Underwriting expenses increased 7.7% in 2024 compared to 2023. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 9.7% in 2024, unchanged from 2023, as improved operating efficiencies and increased operating leverage were offset by increased advertising expenses. The earnings from GEICO’s insurance agency (third-party commissions, net of operating expenses) are included as a reduction of underwriting expenses.

2023 versus 2022

GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings increase in 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies, more favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates and lower advertising costs. However, average claims severities increased in 2023 due to higher auto repair parts prices, labor costs and medical inflation. GEICO sought rate increases in numerous states in 2022 and 2023 in response to accelerating claims costs.

Premiums written increased $730 million (1.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher average premiums per auto policy (16.8%) due to rate increases, partially offset by a 9.8% decrease in policies-in-force. Premiums earned increased $280 million (0.7%) in 2023 compared to 2022. Reductions in advertising expenditures in 2022 and 2023 contributed to reductions of policies-in-force.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $4.5 billion (12.4%) in 2023. GEICO’s loss ratio declined 12.1 percentage points compared to 2022, reflecting the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, lower property damage and collision claims frequencies and increased favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates, partially offset by increases in average claims severities across all significant coverages. Average claim severities increased for property damage (fourteen to sixteen percent range), collision (four to six percent range) and bodily injury (five to seven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $1.5 billion in 2023 and $653 million in 2022.

Underwriting expenses decreased $752 million (16.5%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The expense ratio in 2023 was 9.7%, a decrease of 2.0 percentage points compared to 2022, attributable to reduced advertising expenses and improved operating leverage.

2024 versus 2023

Premiums written increased $694 million (3.8%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases at NICO Primary, BH Direct and BHHC, partially offset by a 16.3% reduction at GUARD. The increases at NICO Primary and BHHC were primarily attributable to commercial auto coverage, while the increase at BH Direct reflected growth across several product lines. The decline at GUARD resulted from management’s decision to exit admitted homeowners’ insurance and to tighten underwriting guidelines in other lines of business.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.4 billion (12.8%) and the loss ratio increased 2.1 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. Losses incurred included reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior accident years’ claims of $52 million in 2024 and $537 million in 2023. The comparative decline reflected a significant increase in loss estimates at GUARD and lower reductions in estimated losses across several of our other businesses that write medical professional liability and commercial liability coverages, partially offset by increased reductions of property loss estimates. During 2024, due to deteriorating loss experience, management at GUARD performed a comprehensive review of claims and significantly increased estimated ultimate claim liabilities. The reduction of favorable development of prior years’ liability claims estimates across our other businesses was attributable to unfavorable social inflation trends, including the impacts of jury awards and litigation costs. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were approximately $350 million in 2024 and were minimal in 2023.

Insurance—Underwriting

Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group

Underwriting expenses increased $681 million (15.0%) and the expense ratio increased 1.3 percentage points to 27.8% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily attributable to BH Specialty from changes in business mix and GUARD due to increased expenses and lower premiums earned.

2023 versus 2022

Premiums written increased $3.5 billion (24.1%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of RSUI and CapSpecialty ($2.1 billion), as well as comparative increases from BHSI and BH Direct, and, to a lesser extent, the other businesses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.3 billion (13.5%) in 2023 compared to 2022, attributable to the acquisition of RSUI and CapSpecialty and changes in business mix, partially offset by a decline in significant catastrophe losses of approximately $600 million. Net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events were $537 million in 2023 and $428 million in 2022.

Underwriting expenses increased $1.1 billion (30.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the increases in premiums earned and changes in business mix, including the full year effects in 2023 of the acquisition of RSUI and CapSpecialty.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Insurance—Underwriting

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $420 million (3.3%) and the loss ratio decreased 2.6 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were approximately $800 million in 2024 and $900 million in 2023. Estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior accident years were reduced $1.7 billion in 2024 and $1.4 billion in 2023, mostly attributable to lower-than-expected property losses.

Underwriting expenses increased $429 million (7.4%) and the expense ratio increased 1.5 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2024, NICO recorded a pre-tax charge in underwriting expenses of $490 million in connection with a settlement agreement reached concerning certain non-insurance affiliates that filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in 2023. See Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Underwriting expenses also included pre-tax foreign currency exchange gains from the remeasurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of $121 million in 2024 and losses of $189 million in 2023. Before these items, underwriting expenses increased $249 million (4.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023.

2023 versus 2022

Premiums written in 2023 increased 31.8% over 2022, reflecting the impact of the TransRe Group acquisition ($4.3 billion), net increases in new property business and higher rates. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $2.1 billion in 2023 versus 2022. The increase in 2023 reflected the TransRe Group acquisition ($2.6 billion), as well as a comparative reduction in losses from significant catastrophe events of $1.1 billion. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years were reduced $1.4 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2022.

Underwriting expenses increased $2.5 billion in 2023 versus 2022, reflecting the impact of the TransRe Group acquisition. The expense ratio increased 6.0 percentage points compared to 2022. Underwriting expenses also included pre-tax foreign currency exchange losses of $189 million in 2023 compared to gains of $371 million in 2022.

Premiums earned in 2024 declined $74 million compared to 2023, which included a reduction of $161 million attributable to the commutations of several U.S. life contracts in the first quarter of 2023. Otherwise, premiums earned declined $235 million (4.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to reductions in non-U.S. life business, and were substantially unchanged in 2023 versus 2022.

Pre-tax underwriting earnings decreased $131 million in 2024 compared to 2023, which increased $245 million over 2022. Earnings included gains from life contract commutations of $53 million in 2024 and $134 million in 2023. Otherwise, underwriting earnings in 2024 decreased $50 million compared to 2023, reflecting decreased earnings from non-U.S. life business and increased losses from the U.S. long-term care business in run-off, partly offset by increased earnings from U.S. life business.

Retroactive reinsurance

Pre-tax underwriting results from retroactive reinsurance derive from changes in the ultimate claim liability estimates and changes in the related deferred charge assets, as well as from foreign currency exchange gains and losses attributable to non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced pre-tax gains of $52 million in 2024, losses of $57 million in 2023 and gains of $168 million in 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange gains and losses were $898 million in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2023 and $836 million in 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Insurance—Underwriting

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group

Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts increased $196 million in 2024, $1.1 billion in 2023 and $86 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 was derived from higher estimates for asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims, which net of changes in deferred charges, produced a pre-tax loss of $650 million in 2023. The net effects of the increases in ultimate claim liabilities in 2024 and 2022 were relatively insignificant.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $2.2 billion in 2024 to $32.4 billion on December 31, 2024, primarily due to loss payments. Deferred charge assets on retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $698 million in 2024 to $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024. Deferred charge balances will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.

Periodic payment annuity

Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. In 2023 and 2024, premium rates for new business were at unacceptable levels and we wrote no new business in either year.

Pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts in each period included the accretion of discounted liabilities, including liabilities for contracts without life contingencies, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were insignificant in 2024 and produced pre-tax losses of $60 million in 2023 and pre-tax gains of $71 million in 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency effects were $596 million in 2024, $590 million in 2023 and $694 million in 2022. Pre-tax losses included a loss of approximately $130 million in 2022 from the settlement of a terminated reinsurance contract. Periodic payment annuity liabilities were $14.3 billion at December 31, 2024, including liabilities of $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and excluding the effects of discount rate changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Variable annuity

Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $157 million in 2024, $233 million in 2023 and $467 million in 2022. Earnings are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts have been in run-off for many years.

Interest and other investment income increased $5.5 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, which increased $4.4 billion compared to 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in U.S. Treasury Bill and short-term investment balances. The increase in 2023 over 2022 was due to increased short-term investment balances and higher interest rates, as well as the impact of income earned from Alleghany’s insurance subsidiary assets acquired in October 2022. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Insurance—Investment Income

Dividend income declined $302 million (5.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, which declined $539 million (8.9%) compared to 2022. The decreases reflected the impact of net reductions in our equity security holdings, partially offset by higher dividend rates on certain of our holdings. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees.

Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities assumed under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and certain other liabilities, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. The effect of discount rate changes on long-duration insurance contracts, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, are excluded from float, as such amounts are not included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Float was approximately $171 billion at December 31, 2024, $169 billion at December 31, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. The cost of float is measured as the ratio of pre-tax underwriting earnings to float balances. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2024 and 2023, and the average cost of float was negative in each year. The cost of float in 2022 was nominal.

2024 versus 2023

Railroad operating revenues declined 0.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower average revenue per car/unit of 6.6%, primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix changes, partially offset by a net volume increase of 6.5%. Pre-tax earnings were $6.6 billion in 2024, a slight increase from 2023. Railroad operating earnings in 2024 increased due to volume growth and lower operating costs from improved productivity, partially offset by a $290 million charge related to a labor agreement that was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2024 and by increased litigation accruals.

Operating revenues from consumer products increased 7.1% in 2024 to $8.4 billion compared to 2023, reflecting a volume increase of 16.2% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher intermodal shipments from west coast imports and volumes from a new intermodal customer.

Operating revenues from industrial products declined 1.2% in 2024 to $5.6 billion from 2023, reflecting slight declines in volume and average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily due to lower aggregates, taconite, minerals and waste shipments, substantially offset by higher plastics and petroleum products volumes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Burlington Northern Santa Fe

Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 4.5% to $5.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to a volume increase of 7.4%, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain, renewable fuels and fertilizer shipments.

Operating revenues from coal decreased 22.5% to $2.9 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 17.9% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily due to lower natural gas prices.

Railroad operating expenses were $15.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $173 million (1.1%) compared to 2023. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 0.4 percentage points to 68.0% in 2024 versus 2023. Railroad compensation and benefits expenses increased $356 million (6.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $290 million charge related to a one-time payment included in the agreement with the SMART-TD labor union that was finalized in December 2024. This agreement allows BNSF the ability to redeploy brakepersons to conductors and engineers, which will allow BNSF to meet short-term hiring demands. Fuel expenses declined $417 million (11.3%) compared to 2023, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, partially offset by higher volumes. Railroad purchased services, equipment rents, materials and other expenses declined $126 million (3.0%), primarily due to cost reductions across numerous spend categories and lower property taxes, partially offset by a litigation charge in 2024 related to a judgment in an ongoing legal case with the Swinomish Tribe, which BNSF has appealed.

2023 versus 2022

Railroad operating revenues declined 6.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower overall volumes (5.7%) and average revenue per car/unit (0.6%), which was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by favorable price and mix. Pre-tax earnings were $6.6 billion in 2023, a decline of 14.2% from 2022, reflecting lower volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs.

Operating revenues from consumer products declined 14.7% in 2023 to $7.9 billion compared to 2022, reflecting a volume decrease of 8.4% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from reduced West Coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in the domestic trucking market, which negatively impacted demand. These declines were partially offset by an increase in automotive volume.

Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.7 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.8% from 2022, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 0.8%. The volume decline was primarily due to lower demand for chemicals, plastics, minerals, paper and lumber, partially offset by increased shipments of steel and aggregates.

Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, attributable to a volume decrease of 2.9%, partially offset by slightly higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains and feedstocks and renewable diesel.

Operating revenues from coal declined 3.4% to $3.8 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 4.0%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline reflected moderating demand attributable to lower natural gas prices.

Railroad operating expenses were $16.1 billion in 2023, a decline of $541 million (3.3%) compared to 2022. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 2.5 percentage points to 68.4% in 2023 versus 2022. Fuel expenses declined $897 million (19.6%) compared to 2022, reflecting lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved efficiency. Railroad compensation and benefits expenses increased $247 million (4.7%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher headcount and wage inflation. Other revenues (expenses), net increased 90% compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher interest rates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Berkshire Hathaway Energy

2024 versus 2023

Our U.S. utilities operate independently in several states, including Utah, Oregon, Wyoming and other Western states (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). Net earnings increased $1.1 billion (116.4%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Pre-tax loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, for the Wildfires were $346 million in 2024 and $1.7 billion in 2023. See Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires.

Additionally, net earnings of U.S. utilities in 2024 reflected comparative increases in electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), income tax benefits from recognized wind production tax credits ($157 million) and other income, partially offset by increases in other energy operating expenses and interest expense.

The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.8 billion in 2024, an increase of $274 million (3.6%) compared to 2023. The increase reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories and higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs and lower wholesale volumes and prices. Retail customer volumes increased 3.6% overall (up 6.5% at NV Energy, 3.1% at PacifiCorp and 1.2% at MEC) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in customer usage and the average number of customers, partially offset by an overall unfavorable impact of weather. The increase in other energy operating expenses was primarily due to higher vegetation management and other wildfire mitigation costs, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs. Interest expense increased $314 million in 2024 over 2023, largely due to increased borrowings, including $4.4 billion of subsidiary term debt issued in January 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.

Net earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $153 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in earnings reflected reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the impact of a higher effective income tax rate, due to the acquisition of an additional 50% limited partner interest in Cove Point on September 1, 2023. Pre-tax earnings of the natural gas pipelines in 2024 were unchanged from 2023.

Net earnings of other energy businesses increased $310 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid, partially offset by lower earnings from the renewable energy business. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher distribution revenue due to higher tariffs from inflation adjustments and lower income tax expense attributable to charges recognized in 2023 for the U.K. Energy Profits Levy and a group relief tax benefit recognized in 2024, partially offset by unfavorable results from the upstream gas exploration and production business and higher operating expenses. Earnings from the renewable energy business decreased mainly due to lower earnings from wind tax equity investments in 2024 and debt extinguishment gains recognized in 2023.

Net earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $120 million 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to charges in connection with the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries and effectuate a nationwide class settlement. See Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The real estate brokerage business continues to be negatively impacted by the availability of homes for sale and high home prices.

Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings include BHE corporate interest expense and unallocated corporate and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends include earnings attributable to non-Berkshire owners of BHE common stock and dividends on preferred stock held by other Berkshire subsidiaries. All remaining noncontrolling interests in BHE common stock were acquired in 2024 and the preferred stock is expected to be redeemed in 2025.

2023 versus 2022

Net earnings of the U.S. utilities declined $1.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected an increase in energy operating expenses, including an increase in pre-tax loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, of $1.6 billion for the Wildfires. The decline in earnings also reflected higher interest expense and lower electric utility margin. These items were partially offset by increases in other income and lower depreciation and amortization expense.

The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of $170 million (2.2%) versus 2022. The decline reflected lower volumes and wholesale rates, as well as increased energy costs, partially offset by an increase in retail customer rates in certain territories. Retail customer volumes decreased 0.8% overall (down 0.8% at PacifiCorp and 2.6% at NV Energy and up 1.3% at MEC) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an overall unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by increases in customer usage and the average number of customers.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Berkshire Hathaway Energy

Net earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $39 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases and decreased earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in Cove Point, partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Net earnings of other energy businesses decreased $332 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected lower earnings at Northern Powergrid due to unfavorable results from the upstream gas exploration and production business, including the write-off of capitalized exploration costs and lower gas production volumes and prices, as well as from higher deferred income tax expense related to the enactment of the U.K. Energy Profits Levy. The earnings decline was also attributable to lower earnings from the renewable energy businesses, primarily due to lower income tax benefits, higher operating expenses and lower solar and wind generation from owned projects, partially offset by debt extinguishment gains in 2023.

Net earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $87 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 19% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 28% decrease in closed transaction volumes.

Industrial products

The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. Marmon also includes the Scott Fetzer group businesses. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International), a leader in drag reducing agents for pipelines (LiquidPower Specialty Products) and a structural steel fabrication products business (W&W|AFCO).

2024 versus 2023

Revenues of the industrial products group in 2024 increased $949 million (2.7%) and pre-tax earnings increased $331 million (5.8%) compared to 2023. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2024 were 16.8%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to 2023.

PCC’s revenues were $10.4 billion in 2024, an increase of 12.0% compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser degree, power generation products. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and considerable demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 24.4% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies. Continued growth in revenues and earnings will be predicated on PCC’s ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products, as well as from improvements in industry supply chains and labor relations, which have been constraining commercial aircraft production at original equipment manufacturers.

Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2024, relatively unchanged compared to 2023, as higher volumes were essentially offset by lower selling prices and unfavorable product mix. Sales volumes in 2024 increased 4% compared to 2023, reflecting higher volumes in both the additives and advanced materials businesses. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 30.7% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower raw material costs, higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

Marmon’s revenues were $12.2 billion in 2024, a decline of 1.7% compared to 2023. The largest revenue declines were experienced by the Transportation Products group (18.2%), attributable to volume declines in the truck, trailer, and aftermarket automotive markets, as well as the Metal Services group (13.9%) and Retail Solutions group (9.4%), primarily due to reduced volume and changes in sales mix. Conversely, Electrical group revenues increased 6.0% due to higher copper prices and increased volumes. The Rail & Leasing group revenues increased 10.5% due to higher average lease renewal rates and increased railcar repair prices and volumes.

Marmon’s pre-tax earnings declined 8.7% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower earnings from the Transportation Products, Metals Services and Retail Solutions groups due to the revenue declines, as well as lower earnings from the Crane Services group, attributable to lower revenues and higher costs, and the Electrical group, reflecting higher materials costs and unfavorable business mix changes. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings in the Rail & Leasing, Medical, Water Technologies and Foodservice Technologies groups.

IMC’s revenues were approximately $3.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of 2.2% compared to 2023. The decline reflected lower organic sales attributable to sluggish customer demand across all major regions, and unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the impact of business acquisitions and higher investment income. The decline in organic sales was attributable to weaker general economic conditions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales and gross margin rates and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher investment and other income. IMC operates globally and a large portion of its products are manufactured in Israel. IMC’s operations in Israel have not been significantly impacted by the conflicts in the region.

2023 versus 2022

Revenues of the industrial products group in 2023 increased $4.1 billion (13.2%) and pre-tax earnings increased $824 million (16.9%) compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2023 increased 0.5 percentage points to 16.3%.

PCC’s revenues were $9.3 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.7 billion (22.7%) compared to 2022. The revenue increase in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and, to a lesser degree, power generation products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion in 2023, an increase of 30.0% compared to 2022 attributable to increases in sales and manufacturing and operating efficiencies in aerospace businesses, partially offset by operating losses in energy products businesses.

Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 4.0% compared to 2022. The revenue decline was primarily due to a 7.9% decline in volumes and unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2023 were relatively unchanged compared to 2022. Earnings included insurance recoveries of $11 million in 2023 and $242 million in 2022 in connection with fires at the Rockton, Illinois facility in 2021 and the Rouen, France facility in 2019. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings in 2023 increased due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices, favorable changes in product mix and lower raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses.

Marmon’s revenues were $12.5 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion (11.0%) compared to 2022. Business acquisitions represented substantially all of the comparative revenue increase. In addition, the Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies, Medical, Metal Services and Crane Services groups generated higher revenues, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. Revenues in 2023 of the Electrical group’s building wire business and the Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups were negatively impacted by lower metals prices, while revenues of the Transportation Products group reflected declining demand, particularly in the second half of the year.

Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 13.1% in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase in 2023 reflected the impacts from business acquisitions ($90 million) and losses of $90 million in 2022 from the shutdown of the Rail & Leasing group business in Russia. The Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups generated higher organic earnings in 2023, which were offset by lower earnings from the Electrical group’s building wire business and from the Metals Services and Medical groups.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

IMC’s revenues increased 8.0% to $4.0 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected the impact of business acquisitions, organic sales growth in North America and other regions and higher interest income due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower revenues in the Asia-Pacific region, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 6.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to higher interest income. The impact of the revenue increase was largely offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the adverse effects of geopolitical conflicts.

Building products

The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).

2024 versus 2023

Revenues of the building products group increased $560 million (2.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Pre-tax earnings decreased $53 million (1.3%) in 2024 compared to 2023.

Clayton Homes’ revenues increased 8.5% in 2024 to $12.4 billion compared to 2023. Revenues from home sales increased $565 million (6.4%) in 2024, reflecting higher new home unit sales of 11.5%, partially offset by changes in sales mix and lower average selling prices. Also, financial services revenues increased 15.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased interest income from higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 14.0% since December 31, 2023. Loan portfolio balances are largely funded by borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates.

Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings declined $115 million (5.6%) in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to lower earnings from financial services (4.4%) and manufacturing activities (9.4%). The decline in financial services earnings reflected increased losses from homeowner property insurance claims, increased expected loan loss provisions due to higher loan originations, higher interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates. Interest expense increased $203 million (38%) in 2024 versus 2023, as borrowings from affiliates increased $6.6 billion in 2024 to $24.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The corresponding interest income on such borrowings is included in the “Other” earnings section on page K-54. The decline in manufacturing earnings was largely attributable to lower gross margin rates due to the increased cost of building homes to the Department of Energy’s Zero Energy Ready Home Program requirements (such incremental costs are partially offset by income tax credits).

Our other building products businesses generated revenues of approximately $14.1 billion in 2024, a decline of $413 million (2.8%) versus 2023. Sales volumes in 2024 increased at Johns Manville and declined at the other businesses in the group, while average selling prices were lower at Johns Manville and MiTek and slightly higher at our other businesses.

Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $61 million (2.9%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Earnings as a percentage of revenues increased 0.9 percentage points in 2024 to 15.6% compared to 2023. Earnings increased in 2024 from higher average gross margin rates arising from lower raw material costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies at certain of the businesses, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and the impact of lower sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses in each year included losses from business restructuring activities and divestitures, as well as legal settlements and accruals.

2023 versus 2022

Revenues of the building products group decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) and pre-tax earnings decreased $602 million (12.6%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses.

Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $11.4 billion in 2023, a decrease of $1.3 billion (10.3%) compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $1.6 billion (15.3%) in 2023 to approximately $8.8 billion, primarily due to lower unit sales and changes in product mix. New home unit sales declined 13.7% in 2023, reflecting lower factory-built and site-built homes. Financial services revenues increased 12.2% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased interest income on higher average loan balances.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.0 billion in 2023, a decrease of $326 million (13.8%) compared to 2022. Earnings in 2023 reflected lower earnings from the home building businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from financial services. The decline in earnings from the home building businesses reflected the reduction in sales, a lower overall gross sales margin rate and higher operating expenses relative to sales. The increase in earnings from financial services was primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims.

Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of 10.0% versus 2022. The decline in revenues reflected overall lower sales volumes and changes in product mix, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.1 billion in 2023, a decrease of 11.4% compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 14.7% in 2023, a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared to 2022. The earnings decline in 2023 was driven by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and losses from restructurings, plant closures and divestitures in 2023, partially offset by lower raw material costs and energy costs as well as reduced freight, shipping and utilities expenses.

Consumer products

The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes a global toy company (Jazwares), jewelry products (Richline) and custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl).

2024 versus 2023

Consumer products group revenues were $14.9 billion in 2024, an increase of 2.2% compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues from Forest River, Brooks Sports and Duracell, partially offset by lower revenues from Fruit of the Loom, Garan and Richline. Forest River revenues increased 6.4% in 2024, reflecting a 7.9% increase in unit sales, which included the impact of business acquisitions in 2024 and 2023. Average selling prices for recreational vehicles declined and increased for bus and commercial vehicles, primarily attributable to changes in product mix. Brooks Sports and Duracell revenues increased 9.1% and 2.5%, respectively, in 2024 versus 2023. The revenue reductions at Fruit of the Loom and Richline were attributable to lower sales volumes, whereas the decline at Garan was attributable to lower average selling prices.

Consumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $172 million (10.9%) in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings from our apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from Jazwares. Apparel and footwear earnings increased 37.0% in 2024 from 2023, primarily due to gross sales margin rate increases from lower sales markdowns, lower manufacturing costs and increased gains on asset sales, as well as from the favorable effects of past restructuring and cost management efforts. The earnings increase at Duracell was attributable to increased gross sales margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, including lower restructuring costs. The decline in earnings from Jazwares in 2024 was primarily due to increased amortization expense, as well as reduced orders from retailers during the fourth quarter.

2023 versus 2022

Consumer products group revenues declined $1.5 billion (9.4%) in 2023 versus 2022. The decline reflected lower revenues at Forest River and our apparel and footwear operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, which contributed revenues of $1.3 billion in 2023 and $240 million in 2022.

Forest River revenues declined 26.2% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting a 29.3% decline in unit sales and changes in sales mix. Forest River experienced strong recreational vehicle unit sales through the first half of 2022. Through most of 2023, sales of recreational vehicles declined significantly, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. The decline in recreational vehicle sales was partially offset by increased sales of bus and commercial vehicles.

Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $452 million (9.4%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline was primarily due to reduced apparel revenues, attributable to lower unit volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Duracell’s revenues in 2023 were relatively flat versus 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

Pre-tax earnings of the consumer products group increased $46 million (3.0%) in 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings in 2023 reflected the impact of the Jazwares acquisition and higher earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Duracell. Certain of our apparel and footwear businesses took actions in 2023 to reduce inventories and right-size operations. The Forest River earnings decline in 2023 was primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes, while the decline at Duracell was primarily attributable to higher restructuring costs.

Service

Our service group consists of several businesses. The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), provide various facilities construction management services (IPS-Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS)) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). McLane, which we view as a service business, is addressed separately since it is deemed a separate segment for financial reporting purposes.

2024 versus 2023

Service group revenues were $20.7 billion in 2024, a slight increase compared to 2023, reflecting revenue increases from aviation services businesses and IPS, partially offset by lower revenues from TTI and XTRA. Aviation services revenues increased 9.1% in 2024, while IPS revenues increased 14.4%. The aviation services increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and increases in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs. The increase at IPS was primarily due to increased project volume.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

TTI revenues declined 10.0% in 2024 compared to 2023. Sales in 2024 declined across most regions, markets and product lines, attributable to excess inventory levels within supply chains, which contributed to lower sales volumes and pricing pressures. The decline at XTRA was due to fewer units on lease.

Service group pre-tax earnings declined 23.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to TTI, the aviation services businesses and XTRA. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues fell 3.4 percentage points in 2024 to 11.1% compared to 2023. Earnings from TTI declined 51.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting the impact of lower sales and price competition, which contributed to reduced gross sales margin rates, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Earnings from aviation services declined 10.9% in 2024 versus 2023, primarily attributable to increased costs of services and leasing, driven by higher flight crew, maintenance, fuel costs and depreciation expense, as well as increased impairment charges. The decline at XTRA was primarily due to lower revenues and increased costs.

2023 versus 2022

Revenues of the service group increased $1.6 billion (8.3%) in 2023 compared to 2022. IPS produced revenues of $1.3 billion in 2023 and $358 million for the post-acquisition period in 2022. Revenues from aviation services increased 11.5% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates.

Revenues from TTI declined 2.7% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 and favorable foreign currency translation effects, revenues declined 5.2% in 2023 versus 2022. Customer orders slowed throughout 2023 in several regions, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, attributable to elevated customer inventory levels and increasing price competition.

Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $52 million (1.7%) in 2023 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues declined 1.5 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline reflected lower earnings from TTI and certain of our other service businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from aviation services and the impact of the IPS acquisition. Earnings from TTI declined 17.3% in 2023, attributable to reduced sales and gross margin rates and higher operating expenses, partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange gains in 2023. The increase in earnings from aviation services was primarily attributable to a 14.4% increase in average aircraft within NetJets’ programs and higher rates.

Retailing

Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), which represented 69% of our retailing group revenue in 2024. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers and insures vehicle service contracts and related insurance products. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 17% of the retailing group revenues in 2024.

Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionery products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Pilot, which is primarily a retail business, is addressed separately since it is deemed a segment for financial reporting purposes.

2024 versus 2023

Retailing group revenues declined 1.2% to $19.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. Except for BHA and Louis, each of our other retailing businesses experienced revenue declines in 2024 compared to 2023. BHA vehicle sales revenues increased 0.5% in 2024 versus 2023. New vehicle unit sales increased 7.9% and pre-owned unit sales declined 2.0% in 2024 versus 2023. Further, average vehicle selling prices were lower in 2024 versus 2023, attributable to increased inventory availability and product mix changes. Revenues of the home furnishings businesses declined 6.4% in 2024 versus 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and price competition. Also, combined revenues of our other retail businesses declined 5.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to increased competition and sluggish consumer demand.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

Retailing group pre-tax earnings declined $331 million (19.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. BHA’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower vehicle gross profit margins, partially offset by higher earnings from finance/service contract and parts/service/repair operations, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $242 million (40.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Most of these other retailers generated significantly lower earnings in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower sales and gross sales margin rates and higher selling, general and administrative expenses as percentages of sales.

2023 versus 2022

Retailing group revenues increased $111 million (0.6%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues increased 3.9% in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 12.6% in 2023 compared to 2022, while revenues from pre-owned retail vehicle sales declined 9.4%. Retail unit sales increased 2.7%, reflecting an 11.7% increase in new vehicles sold and a 4.7% decrease in pre-owned vehicles sold. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations increased 6.6% in 2023 versus 2022. Revenues of our other retailing businesses declined 5.6% in the aggregate versus 2022, due primarily to an 8.6% decline at our home furnishings businesses.

Retailing group pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in 2023, unchanged from 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.7%, primarily due to earnings increases from the parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations, as well as from higher investment income and lower selling, general and administrative and other expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates peaked in mid-2022 and declined through 2023. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $168 million (21.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 28.3% decrease in home furnishings businesses earnings and the impact of a gain in 2022 from the divestiture of certain jewelry stores.

Pilot Travel Centers

Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) operates travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, and fuel-only retail locations. Pilot also operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S.

Through January 31, 2023, we owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot, which we accounted for under the equity method. Our 38.6% proportionate share of Pilot’s net earnings for the month ending January 31, 2023 was included in equity method earnings in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot and owned an 80% controlling financial interest as of that date. Thus, we began consolidating Pilot’s results of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings on February 1, 2023. We acquired the remaining 20% noncontrolling interest in Pilot on January 16, 2024.

Pilot’s earnings for the year ending December 31, 2024, the eleven months ending December 31, 2023 and the full year of 2023 are summarized below (in millions). Revenues, costs and expenses for January 2023 were not included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Manufacturing, Service and Retailing

2024 versus 2023

Pilot’s revenues declined $9.9 billion (17.4%) in 2024 compared to the full year 2023. The decline was primarily attributable to lower average fuel prices and a decline in volumes from non-core fuel activities.

Pilot’s pre-tax earnings declined $442 million (41.9%) in 2024 compared to the full year 2023. Gross sales margins declined 4.3% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to lower diesel margins from lower price volatility. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.3% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, reflecting increased depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as labor, marketing and maintenance costs. Interest expense declined 30.9% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to reduced borrowings and lower rates. In March 2024, Pilot borrowed $5.7 billion from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries and repaid its third-party borrowings. Pilot subsequently repaid $1.0 billion of the affiliate borrowings in 2024. The interest on Pilot’s borrowings from affiliates is included in insurance investment income on page K-39.

McLane

McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“retail”) and to restaurants (“restaurant”). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The retail and restaurant businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. The retail business sales represented 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2024 with the restaurant business generating most of the remainder. These businesses have several significant customers and a reduction in purchasing by any of these customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s revenues and earnings.

2024 versus 2023

Revenues declined 1.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower restaurant business sales (5.7%) and increased retail business sales (1.0%) in 2024 compared to 2023. The decline in restaurant sales reflected lower unit sales attributable to changing consumer preferences for dining at restaurants and quick-service restaurants versus meals-at-home, partially offset by impacts of price inflation. Pre-tax earnings increased $179 million (39.3%) in 2024 compared to 2023 reflecting an increase in gross sales margin rates, which more than offset the impacts of lower sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

2023 versus 2022

Revenues were $52.6 billion in 2023, a decline of $602 million (1.1%) compared to 2022. Revenues from the retail and restaurant businesses declined 0.8% and 2.2%, respectively, while revenues from the beverage business increased 1.9% compared to 2022. Retail and the restaurant business revenues were negatively affected in 2023 by lower unit volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $184 million (67.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected a slight increase in overall gross sales margin rates, increased other income and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses.

Non-Controlled Businesses

After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings from our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum (“Occidental”), Berkadia and Pilot through January 31, 2023. Earnings also included our 38.6% share of Pilot’s earnings for 2022 and for the month of January 2023.

After-tax earnings attributable to these businesses declined $231 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower earnings from Kraft Heinz ($137 million) and the inclusion of Pilot in January 2023 ($83 million). Earnings of non-controlled businesses increased $222 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The comparative increase was primarily due to increased earnings from Occidental, on which we adopted the equity method on August 4, 2022, and Kraft Heinz ($240 million), partially offset by decreased earnings from Pilot ($559 million). As of January 31, 2023, we discontinued using the equity method for our pre-existing 38.6% interest in Pilot upon acquiring a controlling interest in Pilot. In each year, our earnings from Kraft Heinz included the impacts of goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded by Kraft Heinz.

Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries.

Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized gains of $49.3 billion in 2024 and $69.1 billion in 2023 and net losses of $63.1 billion in 2022, attributable to changes in market prices during each year on equity securities we held at the end of each year. We also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during the year, including net gains of $3.5 billion in 2024 and $2.7 billion in 2023 and net losses of $3.9 billion in 2022. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $101.1 billion in 2024, $5.0 billion in 2023 and $769 million in 2022. Investment gains in 2023 included a non-cash pre-tax gain of approximately $3.0 billion related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing interest in Pilot to fair value through the application of acquisition accounting upon attaining control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes.

We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains and losses recorded in earnings in any given period has little analytical or predictive value.

| $ | 1,395 |  |  | $ | (175 | ) |  | $ | 509 |   

After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. These charges arise primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those acquisitions.

Foreign currency exchange rate gains pertain to Berkshire’s and BHFC’s Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. In each year, we recorded foreign currency exchange rate gains due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar, which reduced the U.S. Dollar carrying value of the debt. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Other earnings consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income, intercompany interest income when the related expense is included in earnings of the operating subsidiaries, corporate expenses and unallocated income taxes. Other earnings increased by $484 million in 2024 compared to 2023 and $337 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased interest income, including interest earned on intercompany loans to operating subsidiaries.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Financial Condition

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Berkshire’s shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024 was $649.4 billion, an increase of $88.1 billion since December 31, 2023. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $89.0 billion for 2024 and included after-tax investment gains of approximately $41.6 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities usually produce significant volatility in our earnings.

Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We are not committed to a minimum or subject to a maximum repurchase amount. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $2.9 billion in 2024 to repurchase its common stock.

At December 31, 2024, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (net of payables for unsettled purchases) of $318.0 billion. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities, excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock, were $287.0 billion. During 2024, we paid $9.2 billion to acquire equity securities and we received $143.4 billion from sales of equity securities.

On January 16, 2024, we acquired the remaining 20% noncontrolling ownership interest in Pilot for $2.6 billion. On September 30, 2024, BHE repurchased shares of its common stock held by certain noncontrolling BHE shareholders for $2.9 billion.

Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2024 were $124.8 billion, of which over 95% were issued by the Berkshire parent company and BHFC, or by BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $21.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2023. At various dates in 2024, Berkshire issued approximately ¥837.4 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) of senior note issuances and term loan agreements. The borrowings have interest rates ranging from 0.974% to 2.625% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2054. In 2024, senior note maturities were $1.9 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of Berkshire parent company non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt declined $1.4 billion in 2024 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2024, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest.

BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. In 2024, BNSF issued $1.3 billion of 5.5% debentures due in 2055 and repaid approximately $1.3 billion of debentures. BHE’s aggregate borrowings were approximately $56.4 billion at December 31, 2024, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. In 2024, BHE subsidiaries issued $6.4 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2055 and BHE and its subsidiaries repaid term debt and short-term borrowings aggregating approximately $5.9 billion. In 2025, BHE subsidiaries issued term debt of $1.5 billion, with maturities ranging from 2035 to 2055 and a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.

In 2024, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $30.6 billion, which was net of income tax payments of $28.5 billion. Income tax payments in 2024 included significant U.S. Federal income tax payments derived from taxable gains on sales of equity securities. The gross proceeds from such sales were included in cash flows from investing activities.

Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $19.0 billion in 2024, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $12.7 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. BHE and BNSF forecast capital expenditures in 2025 of approximately $14.0 billion.

Contractual Obligations

We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Our annual debt maturities for the next five years are summarized in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also currently expect to pay interest on our debt ranging from $4.7 billion in 2025 to $4.1 billion in 2029 based on borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024. Certain other obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are as follows (in billions): $2.0 in 2025; $1.8 in 2026; $2.0 in 2027; $2.2 in 2028; and $1.9 in 2029.

We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $148 billion at December 31, 2024. We currently forecast claim payments in 2025 of approximately $38 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2025. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events and can be highly uncertain. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from forecasted payments. We anticipate that claims payments will be funded by operating cash flows.

Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2024, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and purchase commitments of certain materials. We currently estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years will approximate $30 billion, including $12 billion in 2025.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2024 follows.

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process.

As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims typically have relatively short claim-tails, while casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.

Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2024 were approximately $147.6 billion, of which 74% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.

GEICO

GEICO predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance. As of December 31, 2024, GEICO’s gross claim liabilities were $24.8 billion and were $23.9 billion, net of reinsurance. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). A combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.

Claim liability estimates for liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2024, case development liabilities averaged approximately 31% of reported reserves. Case development factors are selected through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.

The adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities is tested using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.

The aggregate claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2023 were reduced by $550 million during 2024, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2024 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.

With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2024. A one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities could produce a $220 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group

BHRG’s property and casualty claims arise from a diverse portfolio of reinsurance contracts underwritten across multiple entities through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2024 follows (in millions).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| Property |  |  | Casualty |  |  | Total |   
Case liabilities | $ | 7,563 |  |  | $ | 11,675 |  |  | $ | 19,238 |   
IBNR liabilities |  | 9,007 |  |  |  | 23,391 |  |  |  | 32,398 |   
Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses |  | 16,570 |  |  |  | 35,066 |  |  |  | 51,636 |   
Reinsurance recoverable |  | 634 |  |  |  | 1,369 |  |  |  | 2,003 |   
Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses | $ | 15,936 |  |  | $ | 33,697 |  |  | $ | 49,633 |   

Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.

The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract (or policy) terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting Estimates

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses

The loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess-of-loss contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary form rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates.

Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. Client reporting of claims information is required based on the terms of the contract at intervals ranging from 30 to 180 days after the end of the quarterly or annual period, reporting practices can vary by jurisdiction. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays depends on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, or the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage.

The premium and loss data BHRG receives is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to audit the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business for compliance with the terms of the policy. Disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies, which are normally resolved through negotiation. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. While we generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates, we may perform our own evaluations certain reported case losses and if deemed appropriate, use our own case liability estimate. As of December 31, 2024, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $1.7 billion. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.

Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:

Paid and incurred loss development methods consider the expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.

Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected reporting patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting Estimates

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses

Frequency and severity methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.

Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.

Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain property, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.

For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.

In 2024, we reduced estimated ultimate pre-2024 accident years’ claim liabilities by $1.7 billion, of which $1.6 billion was attributable to lower-than-expected reported property losses. In 2024, we also reduced estimated ultimate casualty claim liabilities for pre-2024 accident years by approximately $100 million. These reductions produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings.

The portfolios of contracts within the three BHRG Groups vary considerably, covering multiple lines of business within diverse geographic areas and legal environments, which requires us to vary the application of actuarial methods and weighting of assumptions to determine the appropriate ultimate claims estimates. Given the heterogeneity of the groups of contracts and actuarial methods and assumptions applied, we believe it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in any single or limited group of assumptions to the entire portfolio. Moreover, changes in certain assumptions often create iterative impacts on other actuarial assumptions. Accordingly, we believe it is impracticable to provide meaningful quantification of the impact of changes to any limited number of chosen assumptions.

BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses could be materially higher or lower than the liabilities as of December 31, 2024 due to the inherent uncertainty of determining ultimate claims costs for claims that have occurred or will be deemed to have occurred as of the balance sheet date. We currently believe, however, that significant upward revisions to claims estimates are more likely for casualty claims, given longer claims tails and evolving inflation, legal, judicial and mass tort risks, including the manifestation of new forms of claims that were not contemplated when the policies were written. We believe a five percent increase in BHRG’s casualty claim liabilities over time is reasonably possible, although this should not be viewed as a worst-case scenario given the risks identified. An increase of this magnitude to our gross liabilities for casualty claims at December 31, 2024 could produce an increase in casualty liabilities of $1.75 billion, with a corresponding decrease to pre-tax earnings.

Retroactive reinsurance

Our retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify insurance losses from events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with these contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures and we expect the claim-tails will be very long. At December 31, 2024, gross unpaid losses were $32.4 billion.

Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnification and, as such, we currently expect that the aggregate remaining losses payable under our policies will not exceed $47 billion. While ultimate claims will be affected by judicial and legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or mass tort exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that losses will increase to the maximum or decline by more than 15% of our estimated gross claims liability as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting Estimates

Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses

We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends, historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We apply judgmental probability factors to these scenarios to determine an expected outcome. We also monitor subsequent loss payment activity and ceding company reports and other available information. We re-estimate ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed.

Certain of our contracts include asbestos and environmental, as well as other mass tort exposures. Our estimated liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures were approximately $11.9 billion at December 31, 2024. Ceding companies do not consistently provide reliable and detailed underlying claims data, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct detailed analyses of the underlying loss data in making an estimate of ultimate remaining claims liabilities. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we may apply recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation and judicial rulings could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.

Deferred charges for retroactive reinsurance contracts, which at the inception dates of the contracts, represent the excess of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. Deferred charges are subsequently adjusted based on the changes to expected ultimate liabilities and the timing of actual and expected future loss payments. Deferred charge assets were $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024. We estimate that deferred charge assets will decline $830 million in 2025, producing a corresponding charge to pre-tax earnings.

Overall, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior year retroactive reinsurance contracts by $196 million in 2024, primarily for asbestos, environmental and other casualty exposures. This increase, net of the related changes in deferred charge assets had an insignificant impact on underwriting results.

Other Critical Accounting Estimates

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $83.9 billion and indefinite-lived other intangible assets of $18.9 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods may be used to estimate fair values, including market quotations, multiples of earnings and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in fair value determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs.

Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. Reasonable estimates of the fair value of a business enterprise may range widely.

If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.

As of December 31, 2024, we concluded that more-likely-than not, the goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. However, the fair value estimates of the reporting units and assets are subject to change based on market and economic conditions, as well as events affecting our businesses or the industries in which they operate, which we cannot reliably predict. It is reasonably possible that adverse changes in such conditions or events could result in the recognition of impairment losses in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Critical Accounting Estimates

In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, our estimated fair values of seven reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. These reporting units included PCC, as well as three reporting units acquired in late 2022 and early 2023. Our estimated fair value of PCC’s equity exceeded the carrying value of $28.5 billion, which included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion, by nearly 20%. Of the three units acquired in 2022 and 2023, the largest was Pilot, which had an estimated fair value of approximately $20.3 billion and a carrying value of $18.3 billion, including goodwill of $6.5 billion. The remaining five other reporting units had an aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $11.7 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value by approximately 12%. The carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $4.6 billion.

Market Risk Disclosures

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.

Equity Price Risk

Investments in equity securities represent the most significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, our investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2024, approximately 71% of the aggregate fair value of our investments in equity securities was concentrated in five companies.

We often hold our investments for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.

The following table summarizes our investments in equity securities, excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stocks that are accounted for under the equity method, and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as December 31, 2024 and 2023. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not represent the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the concentrations existing in our investment portfolio. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Interest Rate Risk

We also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices or with interest rates considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations and for general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings to minimize the cost of our debt. We generally do not utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.

The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the perceived credit risk, prepayment options, liquidity and other factors, as well as general market conditions.

The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table. Dollars are in millions.

Foreign Currency Risk

Certain of our subsidiaries operate in foreign jurisdictions and we transact business in foreign currencies. In addition, we hold investments in common stocks of major multinational companies, who have significant foreign business and foreign currency risk of their own. In most instances, we do not attempt to match assets and liabilities by currency or use derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risks in a meaningful way.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Foreign Currency Risk

Our net assets subject to financial statement translation into U.S. Dollars are primarily in our insurance, utilities and energy and certain manufacturing subsidiaries. A portion of our financial statement translation-related impact from changes in foreign currency rates is recorded in other comprehensive income. In addition, we include gains or losses from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in net earnings related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities of Berkshire and its U.S.-based subsidiaries. A summary of these gains (losses), after-tax, for each of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023 follows (in millions).

Foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income |  |  | (1,646 | ) |  |  | 749 |   

Commodity Price Risk

Our subsidiaries use commodities in various ways in manufacturing and providing services. As such, we are subject to price risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of our products and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity price increases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We generally do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risks to any significant degree.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(c). In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-64.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses — Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) include short duration property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Key assumptions affecting certain of these claim liabilities include anticipated claims and their severity, expected loss ratios, and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses.

Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether certain of these claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2024 required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain of these claim liabilities included the following, among others:

•

We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.

•

We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis to evaluate that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were accurate and complete.

•

With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:

•

We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development factors as needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.

•

We compared prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the most recent year to identify potential bias in management’s determination of the claim liabilities.

Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses — Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 17 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under retroactive reinsurance contracts (“retroactive claim liabilities”) include property and casualty retroactive reinsurance contracts. Key assumptions affecting certain of these retroactive claim liabilities include anticipated claims and their severity, expected loss ratios, and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses.

Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether certain of these claim liabilities were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2024, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities included the following, among others:

•

We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.

•

We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were accurate and complete.

•

With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:

•

We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared our estimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts, we evaluated the process used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities.

•

We compared prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the most recent year to identify potential bias in management’s determination of the claim liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2024

(1)

Significant accounting policies and practices 

(a)

Nature of operations and basis of consolidation 

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 26. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Certain balances in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations. We reclassified the asset, liability, revenue and expense balances in 2023 associated with Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) from the Railroad, Utilities and Energy sections of the Balance Sheet, Statement of Earnings and Statement of Cash Flows to the Insurance and Other sections of those statements. We also reclassified the balances within the affected Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These reclassifications conform presentations for comparability to presentations in 2024. These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated total assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, revenues, expenses, or on net earnings or cash flows from the amounts previously reported. See Note 1(y) for a summary of the reclassifications.

We continue to believe that reporting the railroad, utilities and energy subsidiaries separately in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Earnings is appropriate, given relative significance of property, plant and equipment, capital expenditures and debt. Further, these subsidiaries are not supported by Berkshire debt guarantees or other financial commitments.

(b)

Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements 

We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance claims are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with determinations of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Additionally, significant estimates may be required in the evaluation of certain other long-lived assets for impairments and the recognition of expected credit losses on amounts owed to us. Estimates may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods due to ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(c)

Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills 

Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills have maturities exceeding three months and less than one year at the time of purchase.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Significant accounting policies and practices

(d)

Investments in fixed maturity securities 

We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Our investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method.

We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in earnings when the securities are sold. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate unrealized losses, considering the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated expected cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.

(e)

Investments in equity securities 

We carry investments in equity securities at fair value and record the changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains and losses.

(f)

Investments under the equity method 

We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock, and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-substance common stock as defined by GAAP.

In applying the equity method, we increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record additional investments at cost and equity distributions received as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee.

(g)

Loans and finance receivables 

Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are capitalized and accrued to investment income as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans.

Measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.

(g) Loans and finance receivables

Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent.

Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.

(h)

Other receivables 

Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premiums receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables arise from unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on property and casualty claims and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances.

We measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history. In addition, our credit loss estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge off receivables against the allowances after reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.

(i)

Derivatives 

We carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances are net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable.

(j)

Fair value measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets when estimating fair value. In such circumstances, alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.

(k)

Inventories 

Inventories consist of manufactured products, goods or products acquired for resale, materials and supplies and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2024, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value 32% of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease 

We use property, plant and equipment in our operations. We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions, improvements and betterments to such properties at cost. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs, including interest over the construction period, are capitalized. With respect to constructed assets that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred.

Depreciation expense of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 45 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years.

We depreciate property, plant and equipment used in operations by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 30 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 4 to 15 years. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life.

We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value.

(m)

Leases 

We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.

Goodwill and other intangible assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the acquisition date values of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess up to the balance of goodwill is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.

Other intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. When the asset carrying value exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

(o)

Revenue recognition 

We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. We earn such premiums, in most cases ratably, over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are normally received in full and are fully earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are received in full and fully earned at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts.

Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.

We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. We also sell fuels, including diesel, gasoline and related products, on a retail and wholesale basis.

Our sales contracts provide customers with products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service.

Sales revenues reflect reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenues include certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenues exclude sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenues include consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services that are performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue.

Product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs over time with respect to certain contracts, including certain bridge and structural steel, castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract.

Revenue recognition 

The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments.

Utilities and energy revenues derive primarily from regulated electricity and natural gas sales. Regulated electricity and natural gas revenues are primarily tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Such revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for regulated energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued.

Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are completed. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, construction management and consulting, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising activities and news distribution.

Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases.

(p)

Losses and loss adjustment expenses 

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the undiscounted estimated ultimate payment amounts.

We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are stated net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable ceded under reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.

(q)

Retroactive reinsurance contracts 

We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short-duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with property and casualty contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently adjust deferred charge assets as of the balance sheet date based on changes in the estimated timing and amount of ultimate loss payments, with retrospective application to the inception of the contract using the interest method. The resulting changes in deferred charge assets are included as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Insurance policy acquisition costs 

Deferred policy acquisition costs are included in other assets and were approximately $4.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, of which $3.9 billion in each year related to property and casualty insurance contracts. We capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. For short-duration property and casualty insurance contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs are reflected in expenses over the contract term as the related premiums are earned. For long-duration life contracts, we expense deferred policy acquisition costs at a constant level based on the expected amount of insurance in-force and the expected term of the contract using the assumptions consistent with those used in determining related insurance liabilities.

(s)

Life, annuity and health insurance benefits 

Liabilities for life, annuity and health insurance benefits under long-duration insurance contracts represent the present value of expected future cash outflows from future benefit payments and certain non-acquisition costs, less the present value of expected future “net premiums,” which is the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all expected future benefits and variable expenses. Periodic payment and annuity reinsurance contracts are regarded as limited payment contracts. Such liabilities include the present value of expected future payments based on the discount rates used to measure benefit liabilities and deferred profit liabilities, which are based on the excess of gross premiums received over the net premiums established at the inception of the contract.

In estimating future cash flows, we consider the timing and amount of future claims, premiums and expenses, which require estimates of expected mortality, morbidity and lapse rates. Cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are revised each reporting period based on the prevailing upper-medium-grade corporate bond yields (generally single-A rated credit ratings) that reflect the duration and currency attributes of the liabilities. In measuring benefit liabilities, we generally group contracts by contract issue year. The effects of changes in discount rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

(t)

Regulated utilities and energy businesses 

Certain regulated utility and energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities.

Regulatory assets and liabilities are subsequently amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers.

(u)

Foreign currency 

The accounts of certain subsidiaries are measured using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings.

Income taxes 

Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S. with eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in U.S. state and local and foreign jurisdictions. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred income tax assets when realization is deemed to be unlikely.

Liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.

Accounting pronouncements adopted in 2024

We adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update 2023-02, “Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method” (“ASU 2023-02”). ASU 2023-02 permits reporting entities to elect to account for tax equity investments from which the income tax credits are received using the proportional amortization method at the program level if certain conditions are met. We elected to apply the proportional accounting method to eligible affordable housing tax credit investments using the modified retrospective method. We recorded a charge to retained earnings of $127 million, representing the cumulative effect of applying the proportional method to these investments as of January 1, 2024.

We adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”) beginning December 31, 2024. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required only on an annual basis. We adopted ASU 2023-07 retrospectively with such disclosures included in Note 26 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2024

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires detailed disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of specific categories underlying certain expense captions on the income statement. ASU 2024-03 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.

On March 6, 2024, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Release No. 33-11275 and No. 34-99678 “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors” (“Climate Disclosure Rules”). Among its provisions, the Climate Disclosure Rules will require certain disclosures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions, and other disclosures about climate-related risks that materially impacted or are reasonably likely to materially impact the business strategy, results of operations or financial condition of the registrant. The Climate Disclosure Rules were to become effective for large-accelerated SEC filers in annual reports for years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC stayed implementation of the Climate Disclosure Rules, which remains in place pending the completion of an ongoing judicial review.

Significant business acquisitions and other transactions 

Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.

On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“Pilot”) for approximately $8.2 billion. The acquisition increased our interest to 80%, representing a controlling interest in Pilot for financial reporting purposes as of that date. Accordingly, we began consolidating Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Prior to that date, we accounted for our 38.6% interest in Pilot under the equity method.

Pilot operates travel centers and fuel-only retail locations across the U.S. and in five Canadian provinces, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, as well as large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing businesses in the U.S. Pilot also sells diesel fuel at other locations in the U.S. and Canada through various arrangements with third party travel centers and operates a water disposal business in the oil fields sector.

In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we remeasured our previously held 38.6% investment in Pilot to fair value as of the acquisition date. We recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method.

In January 2024, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests in Pilot for $2.6 billion, increasing our ownership of Pilot to 100%. The acquisition of a noncontrolling interest represents an equity transaction and we recorded an increase of $517 million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest acquired over the consideration paid, net of deferred income tax liabilities arising from the transaction.

A summary of the values of Pilot’s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of January 31, 2023 follows (in millions).

* Goodwill from this acquisition is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) for $11.5 billion, which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. Acquired assets were $35.6 billion, including cash and investments of $19.7 billion and goodwill of $3.9 billion, which is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Liabilities were $24.1 billion, including unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $15.1 billion.

On September 30, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) repurchased 5.85% of its outstanding common stock held by certain noncontrolling BHE shareholders for $2.9 billion. We recorded the difference between the value of the consideration paid for the noncontrolling interests acquired and the carrying value in capital in excess of par value.

Additionally, in September and October 2024, Berkshire acquired the remaining 2.12% of BHE’s outstanding common stock held by noncontrolling shareholders in exchange for 2,291,631 shares of Berkshire Class B common stock valued at $1.045 billion. After these transactions, BHE became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire.

Significant business acquisitions and other transactions

On September 1, 2023, a BHE subsidiary acquired an additional 50% limited partner interest in Cove Point LNG, LP (“Cove Point”) for $3.3 billion, which increased our economic interest from 25% to 75%. Prior to the transaction, we also held 100% of the general partner interest and we consolidated Cove Point for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the interest acquired was an acquisition of a noncontrolling interest. We recorded a charge of $667 million in 2023 to our capital in excess of par for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest acquired and deferred income tax assets arising from the transaction.

Investments in equity securities 

Our investments in equity securities over the years have been concentrated in relatively few companies. The fair value of our five largest holdings at December 31, 2024 and 2023 represented 71% and 79%, respectively, of the aggregate fair value of our equity securities shown in the preceding tables. The five largest holdings at each date were American Express Company, Apple Inc., Bank of America Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation.

Since 2019, we have also owned non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and Occidental common stock warrants. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value and included as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. We account for our investment in Occidental common stock under the equity method. See Note 5.

The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation value. As of December 31, 2024, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $8.5 billion. During 2023, Occidental issued mandatory redemption notifications for approximately $1.5 billion of the aggregate liquidation value due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders, as defined under the terms of the Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations.

The Occidental common stock warrants allow us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed.

As of December 31, 2024, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 21.6% of the outstanding common stock of American Express. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value.

Equity method investments

Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. The most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. We began acquiring common stock of Occidental in 2022 and our aggregate voting interest in Occidental common stock exceeded 20% on August 4, 2022. We adopted the equity method as of that date. As of December 31, 2024, we owned 27.2% of the Kraft Heinz outstanding common stock and 28.2% of the outstanding Occidental common stock which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental’s outstanding common stock warrants.

Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses.

We also own a 50% interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), which is included in other in the following table. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owns the other 50% interest. Berkadia engages in mortgage banking, investment sales and servicing commercial/multi-family real estate loans. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (limited to $1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy.

The fair values and carrying values of these investments are included in the following table (in millions).

Equity method investments

Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stocks are publicly traded. As of December 31, 2024, the excess of our carrying value over the fair value of each of these investments based on their respective market prices was approximately 25% of the carrying value. We evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2024. For each investment, we considered our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value exceeds carrying value, the magnitude and duration of the decline in fair value, the operating results of the company, as well as other factors. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded the recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required.

As of December 31, 2024, the carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximated our share of shareowners’ equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 by approximately $9.9 billion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill.

As described in Note 2, we ceased accounting for Pilot under the equity method as of February 1, 2023. Equity method earnings attributable to Pilot were $105 million for the month ending January 31, 2023 and are reported in other in the following table. Occidental’s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we report the equity method effects for Occidental on a one-quarter lag. Our earnings and distributions received from equity method investments are summarized in the following table (in millions).

Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on equity securities we still own, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year.

In the preceding table, investment gains and losses on equity securities sold during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equity securities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses on equity securities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and cost at the acquisition date. Equity securities sold produced taxable gains of $101.1 billion in 2024, $5.0 billion in 2023 and $769.0 million in 2022. Other investment gains included approximately $3.0 billion in 2023 from the remeasurement of our pre-existing 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP.

Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries 

Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $31 billion as ordinary dividends during 2025. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $5.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $310 billion at December 31, 2024 and $303 billion at December 31, 2023. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, the recognition of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance, life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and deferred income taxes under GAAP differs from recognition under U.S. statutory reporting. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes.

Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim events that have occurred as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred shown in the preceding table related to events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses included losses from significant catastrophe events (losses exceeding $150 million per event) of approximately $1.5 billion in 2024, $925 million in 2023 and $3.1 billion in 2022. Current accident year incurred losses for private passenger auto insurance declined in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower claims frequencies and higher average claims severities. Current accident year incurred losses in 2023 also reflected a decline in private passenger auto insurance losses and the impact of the Alleghany acquisition compared to 2022.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 

We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $2.3 billion in 2024, $3.5 billion in 2023 and $2.7 billion in 2022, which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 2.2% in 2024, 3.5% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2022.

Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our primary insurance businesses declined $602 million in 2024, $2.1 billion in 2023 and $1.1 billion in 2022. The decline in estimated liabilities in 2024 reflected lower-than-expected private passenger auto, medical professional liability and property losses, partially offset by increased casualty losses. The estimated liability reductions in 2023 and 2022 were primarily from private passenger auto, medical professional liability and property coverages. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our reinsurance businesses were reduced $1.7 billion in 2024, $1.4 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2022. The reductions in 2024 and 2023 were primarily attributable to lower-than-expected property losses, while the reductions in 2022 were attributable to both property and casualty losses.

Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental and asbestos exposures, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment, among other factors. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible to arise from these factors.

Disaggregated information concerning our claim liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow for GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). In this discussion, “claim-tail” refers to the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) to our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2024 follows (in millions).

GEICO

GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.

Average liabilities are based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that are quickly settled. Case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, are based on the facts and merits of the claim.

Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. Consequently, additional case development liabilities are established, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR claim liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage based on historical data, from which reported claims are deducted to produce the estimated number of unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 

GEICO’s net auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE incurred and paid are summarized by accident year below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2024 and are net of estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Claim counts are established when accidents that could result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages and may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all auto policy coverages. Dollars are in millions.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 

BH Primary

BH Primary’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical professional liability and workers’ compensation and other casualty insurance, which includes commercial auto and general liability insurance. Net losses and ALAE incurred and paid are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2024. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions.

Medical Professional Liability

Estimates of the ultimate expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for medical professional claim liabilities are based on a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent developments based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 

Workers’ Compensation and Other Casualty

We evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for workers’ compensation and other casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the case development estimates over the case-basis liabilities, is included in IBNR liabilities.

BHRG

We use a variety of methodologies to establish BHRG’s estimates for property and casualty claim liabilities. These methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 

Our claim liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, establish additional case liabilities based on our estimates.

Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.

BHRG’s net losses and ALAE incurred and paid are disaggregated and summarized by accident year based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2024. Dollars are in millions.

Retroactive reinsurance contracts 

Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Exposures may include significant asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024 follow (in millions).

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
| 2024 |  |  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 |

Balance at December 31 | $ | 32,443 |  |  | $ | 34,647 |  |  | $ | 35,415 |   
Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred above | $ | 247 |  |  | $ | 1,109 |  |  | $ | 86 |   
Deferred charge adjustments |  | 698 |  |  |  | 375 |  |  |  | 769 |   
Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, including deferred charge   
adjustments | $ | 945 |  |  | $ | 1,484 |  |  | $ | 855 |   

We classify incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on the inception dates of the contracts, which reflect when our exposure to losses began. We believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by the accident year of the underlying event is irrelevant given that our exposure to losses incepted when the contract incepted. We also believe that the classification of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value. Substantially all of the losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid related to contracts written in prior years.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred include changes in estimated ultimate liabilities and related adjustments to deferred charge assets arising from the changes in the estimated timing and amount of loss payments. In 2023, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities under certain contracts by $1.1 billion, primarily attributable to revised estimates for asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims. Including the adjustments to related deferred charge assets, the increase in ultimate liabilities produced a net expense of approximately $650 million in 2023. Deferred charge assets on retroactive reinsurance contracts were $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2023.

In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tails for many contracts to be very long, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events occur.

We monitor evolving case law and its effect on asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims. Changing laws or government regulations, as well as newly identified toxins and injury events, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. Our estimates of ultimate liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures under our contracts were approximately $11.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $12.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

Notes payable and other borrowings 

Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2024. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

Pilot’s borrowings at December 31, 2023 were primarily secured syndicated loans. In 2024, Pilot borrowed $5.7 billion from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, which Pilot used to repay its then outstanding third-party borrowings.

The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€5.85 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥1,988 billion par at December 31, 2024) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period on our borrowings are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax gains of $1.5 billion in 2024, $217 million in 2023 and $1.7 billion in 2022.

Notes payable and other borrowings of our railroad, utilities and energy businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of December 31, 2024.

BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements. Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In 2024, BHE subsidiaries issued $6.4 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2055 and BHE and its subsidiaries repaid term debt and short-term borrowings aggregating approximately $5.9 billion. In 2025, BHE subsidiaries issued term debt of $1.5 billion, with maturities ranging from 2035 to 2055 and a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%.

BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In 2024, BNSF issued $1.3 billion of 5.5% debentures due in 2055 and repaid $1.3 billion of debentures. As of December 31, 2024, BHE, BNSF and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable debt covenants. Berkshire does not guarantee any debt, borrowings or lines of credit of BHE, BNSF or their subsidiaries.

Unused and available lines of credit and commercial paper capacity to support operations and provide additional liquidity for our subsidiaries were approximately $11.4 billion at December 31, 2024, of which approximately $10.1 billion related to BHE and its subsidiaries.

We have not established deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely. Repatriation of all accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be impracticable to the extent that such earnings represent capital to support ongoing business operations. Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law. However, distributions to the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions could be subject to withholding and other local taxes.

* U.S. income tax credits derive primarily from production tax credits associated with wind-energy generation of BHE and tax credits arising from affordable housing investments.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2013, and the IRS is currently auditing tax years 2014 through 2019. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2025. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, net unrecognized tax benefits were $501 million and $480 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2024, were $448 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We do not expect material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2025.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted Pillar Two rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation to adopt the rules. As currently designed, Pillar Two would apply to our worldwide operations. We do not currently have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum tax rate, and we do not currently expect these rules will materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules.

Fair value measurements 

The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.

Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.

Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.

Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities.

Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2024 follow (in millions).

Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred and common stock warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are private placements and are not traded in securities markets. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of illiquidity and subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the warrant model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,438,223 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 1,441,483 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding.

Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

Pension plans 

Certain Berkshire subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation or fixed benefit rates. Plan sponsors may make contributions to the plans to meet regulatory requirements or may make discretionary contributions. Benefits under qualified U.S. and certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are funded with assets held in trusts. Certain other non-qualified retirement plans are unfunded. Our net periodic pension expense for each of the three years ending December 31, 2024 was as follows (in millions). 

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based on service and compensation prior to the valuation date. The ABO was $11.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and $12.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) is the actuarial present value of benefits earned based upon service and compensation prior to the valuation date and, if applicable, includes assumptions regarding future compensation levels.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Our subsidiaries may also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans. Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and specific plan provisions. Several of these plans provide for employer matching contributions as specified in the plans and may provide for additional discretionary employer contributions. Our defined contribution plan expense was approximately $1.3 billion in 2024, $1.1 billion in 2023 and $0.8 billion in 2022.

Business segment data 

Berkshire’s numerous and diverse businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. These businesses are aggregated into operating segments in a manner that reflects how Berkshire views the business activities. Berkshire’s chief operating decision maker consists of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations and the Vice Chairman of Non-Insurance Operations. This group participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, evaluating operating performance and selecting the chief executive to head each of the operating segments. Investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Certain operating segments are aggregated into reportable business segments based upon similar products or product lines, marketing strategies, and selling and distribution characteristics.

Business segment data

Berkshire’s reportable business segments are as follows.

|  |   
---|---|---  
Business Segment |  | Principal Business Activities  
Insurance: |  |   
GEICO |  | Underwriting private passenger automobile insurance mainly by direct response methods  
|  |   
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group |  | Underwriting multiple lines of property and casualty insurance policies for primarily commercial accounts  
|  |   
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group |  | Underwriting excess-of-loss, quota-share and facultative reinsurance worldwide  
|  |   
Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) |  | Operator of one of the largest railroad systems in North America  
|  |   
Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) |  | Regulated electric and gas utility, including power generation and distribution activities and real estate brokerage activities  
|  |   
Manufacturing |  | Manufacturers of numerous products including industrial, consumer and building products, including home building and related financial services  
|  |   
Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) (1) |  | Operator of travel centers in North America and a marketer of wholesale fuel  
|  |   
McLane Company (“McLane”) |  | Wholesale distribution of food and non-food items to retailers and restaurants  
|  |   
Service and retailing |  | Providers of numerous services including shared aircraft ownership programs, aviation pilot training, electronic components distribution, various retailing businesses, including automobile dealerships and over-the-road trailer and furniture leasing  

——————

(1) Pilot’s statement of earnings and capital expenditure segment data in 2023 is for the eleven months ending December 31, 2023. Our earnings from Pilot in 2022 and for the month of January 2023 were determined under the equity method and included in earnings from non-controlled businesses.

The tabular information that follows shows data of Berkshire’s business segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when those transactions are considered in assessing the results of the respective segments and are not considered to be material. Furthermore, investment gains and losses, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments and amortization of certain acquisition accounting adjustments or certain other corporate income and expense items are not considered in assessing the financial performance of operating businesses. Collectively, these items are included in corporate, eliminations and other to reconcile segment totals to consolidated amounts.

The cost and expense information provided is based on the information regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. Given the number and diversity of Berkshire’s operating segments and the differences in revenue streams and cost structures, there are wide variances in the form, content and levels of such expense information significant to the business. Expenses considered significant for one operating segment may not be significant in others.

With respect to insurance underwriting, the chief operating decision maker considers pre-tax underwriting earnings to allocate resources and capital, together with perceived risks and opportunities in the insurance markets that affect rates and risks of loss. Typically, there are no budgeted or forecasted premiums or underwriting results.

For most non-insurance businesses, pre-tax earnings are considered in allocating resources and capital, although income taxes are also considered at BHE, given the magnitude of production tax credits associated with wind-powered electricity generation investments and the related impacts from regulation. The chief operating decision maker generally considers actual operating results versus budgets or forecasts, as well as unique perceived risks and opportunities associated with the individual operating businesses.

Business segment data

We view our insurance segment as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the underwriting managers, while investment decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s CEO and other corporate investment managers. Accordingly, performance of underwriting operations is evaluated without any allocation of investment income. As such, the insurance net investment income is presented in the aggregate as a separate component of insurance segment operating earnings. Earnings data of our business segments for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024 are shown in the following tables (in millions).

Contingencies and commitments 

We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

PacifiCorp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Utah, Oregon, Wyoming and other Western states. HomeServices of America, Inc. (“HomeServices”) is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE. Certain legal matters related to these entities are described below.

PacifiCorp

In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures, contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries, loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. These wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”) indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several other structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. Investigations into the cause and origin of each of the 2020 Wildfires are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp.

Contingencies and commitments 

According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a wildfire began on July 29, 2022, in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp’s service territory (the “2022 Wildfire”) burning over 60,000 acres. Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 Wildfire resulted in 11 structures damaged, 185 structures destroyed, 12 injuries and four fatalities. The U.S. Forest Service issued a Wildland Fire Origin and Cause Supplemental Incident Report. The report concluded that a tree coming in contact with a power line is the probable cause of the 2022 Wildfire. The 2020 Wildfires and 2022 Wildfire, together, are referred to as the “Wildfires.”

As of the date of this filing, a significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims related to the Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with the 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, as well as punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints.

Additionally, PacifiCorp received correspondence from the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice regarding the potential recovery of certain costs and damages alleged to have occurred on federal and state lands in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. In December 2024, the United States of America filed a complaint against PacifiCorp in conjunction with the correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil cover sheet accompanying the complaint demands damages estimated to exceed $900 million. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims.

Amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California approximate $3 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints and the mass complaints described below that seek $48 billion. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount.

Based on available information to date, we believe it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes.

On September 30, 2020, a class action complaint against PacifiCorp was filed captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al. (the “James case”), in Oregon Circuit Court in Multnomah County, Oregon (the “Multnomah Court”) in connection with the 2020 Wildfires. In April 2023, a jury trial for the James case with respect to 17 named plaintiffs began in Multnomah Court. In June 2023, the jury issued its verdict finding PacifiCorp liable to the 17 named plaintiffs and to the class with respect to four wildfires. The jury found PacifiCorp’s conduct grossly negligent, reckless and willful as to each plaintiff and the entire class. The jury awarded the 17 named plaintiffs $90 million of damages, including $4 million of economic damages, $68 million of noneconomic damages and $18 million of punitive damages based on a 0.25 multiplier of the economic and noneconomic damages.

In September 2023, the Multnomah Court ordered trial dates for three damages phase trials for the James case, wherein plaintiffs in each of the three damages phase trials would present evidence regarding their damages.

In January 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award for the June 2023 James case verdict of $92 million based on the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as doubling of the economic damages and offsetting of insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a notice of appeal associated with the June 2023 verdict in the James case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action, and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. On February 14, 2024, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp’s request to stay the damages phase trials. On February 13, 2024, the 17 named plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal as to the January 2024 limited judgment and money award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years.

In January 2024, the jury for the first James case damages phase trial awarded nine plaintiffs $62 million of damages, including $6 million of economic damages and $56 million of noneconomic damages. Subsequently, the Multnomah Court increased the economic damages by $6 million and added $16 million of punitive damages, bringing the aggregate damages awarded to $84 million. In March 2024, the Multnomah Court granted in large part PacifiCorp’s request to offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the nine plaintiffs. In April 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award of $80 million for the January 2024 James verdict, based on the aggregate damages awarded, offset by insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs.

Contingencies and commitments 

In March 2024, the jury for the second James case damages phase trial awarded ten plaintiffs $42 million of damages, including $12 million of doubled economic damages and $30 million of noneconomic and punitive damages. In May 2024, the Multnomah Court granted PacifiCorp’s request to offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the ten plaintiffs. In June 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award of $38 million for the March 2024 James verdict, based on the aggregate amounts awarded, offset by insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs.

The January, April and June 2024 limited judgments created liens against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In each instance, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under ORS 82.010, interest at a rate of 9% per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict and further amended its appeal of the June 2023 verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. PacifiCorp’s opening brief is due to be filed with the Oregon Court of Appeals on or before February 25, 2025, in connection with its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict and the January and March 2024 verdicts for the first two James damages phase trials.

In February 2025, the jury for the third James case damages phase trial awarded seven plaintiffs $32 million of noneconomic damages in addition to $4 million of economic damages stipulated for eight plaintiffs prior to the trial. In accordance with Oregon law, plaintiffs asked the court to double the economic damages to $8 million after the verdict. PacifiCorp expects the court will award the doubling of economic damages and also increase the award for $9 million in punitive damages by applying the 0.25 multiplier of economic and noneconomic damages consistent with the June 2023 James verdict. As a result, PacifiCorp expects the total award for the eight plaintiffs to be approximately $49 million. PacifiCorp filed post-trial motions with the Multnomah Court requesting the court offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the eight plaintiffs. PacifiCorp intends to appeal the jury’s damage awards associated with the February 2025 jury verdict once judgment is entered.

In March 2024, settlement was reached with five commercial timber plaintiffs in the James case, and the jury trial scheduled for April 2024 was cancelled.

Between April 2024 and January 2025, six separate mass complaints against PacifiCorp naming 1,591 individual class members were filed in the Multnomah Court referencing the James case as the lead case. Complaints for five of the plaintiffs in the mass complaints were subsequently dismissed. These James case mass complaints make damages-only allegations seeking economic, noneconomic and punitive damages, as well as doubling of economic damages. In December 2024, two additional complaints were filed in Multnomah Court on behalf of eight plaintiffs also referencing the James case as the lead case. PacifiCorp believes the magnitude of damages sought by the class members in the James case mass complaints and additional two complaints to be of remote likelihood of being awarded based on the amounts awarded in the jury verdicts described above that are being appealed.

In October 2024, the Multnomah Court issued a case management order, which sets forth nine additional damages phase trials with up to ten plaintiffs per trial. The trials are scheduled to occur throughout 2025, with the verdict for the first trial received in February 2025, as described above.

A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate.

Estimated probable losses associated with the Wildfires were based on the information available to the date of this filing, including (i) ongoing cause and origin investigations; (ii) ongoing settlement and mediation discussions; (iii) other litigation matters and upcoming legal proceedings; and (iv) the status of the James case. Wildfire estimated losses include estimates for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is able to reasonably estimate at this time, and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available.

Through December 31, 2024, PacifiCorp recorded cumulative estimated probable Wildfire losses, before taxes and expected related insurance recoveries, of approximately $2.75 billion. Wildfire loss accruals were $346 million in 2024, $1.9 billion in 2023 and $225 million in 2022. Insurance recoveries recorded to date in connection with the Wildfires were $530 million, including $253 million in 2023 and $161 million in 2022. No further insurance recoveries are expected to become available. Cumulative Wildfire loss payments through December 31, 2024 were approximately $1.2 billion, of which $533 million was paid in 2024. Estimated unpaid liabilities for the Wildfires were approximately $1.54 billion at December 31, 2024.

Contingencies and commitments 

It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur significant additional Wildfire losses beyond the amounts currently accrued; however, it is currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case and the 2022 Wildfire, the variation in the types of properties and damages and the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including mediation, settlement negotiations, jury verdicts and the appeals process.

HomeServices of America, Inc.

HomeServices is currently defending against several antitrust cases, all in federal district courts. In each case, plaintiffs claim HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries (and in one case BHE) conspired with co-defendants to artificially inflate real estate commissions by following and enforcing multiple listing service (“MLS”) rules that require listing agents to offer a commission split to cooperating agents in order for the property to appear on the MLS (“Cooperative Compensation Rule”). None of the complaints specify damages sought. However, two cases also allege Texas state law deceptive trade practices claims, for which plaintiffs have asserted damages totaling approximately $9 billion by separate written notice as required by Texas law.

In one of these cases, Burnett (formerly Sitzer) et al. v. HomeServices of America, Inc. et al. (the “Burnett case”), a jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri commenced on October 16, 2023, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on October 31, 2023, finding that the named defendants participated in a conspiracy to follow and enforce the Cooperative Compensation Rule, which conspiracy had the purpose or effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers. The jury further found that the class plaintiffs had proved damages in the amount of $1.8 billion. Joint and several liability applies for the co-defendants. Federal law authorizes trebling of damages and the award of pre-judgment interest and attorney fees. To date, all co-defendants have reached settlements with the plaintiffs. The U.S District Court approved certain of these settlements in May 2024, which has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries in the Burnett case to effectuate a nationwide class settlement. The final settlement agreement includes scheduled payments over the next four years aggregating $250 million. HomeServices received final court approval on November 27, 2024, which has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. If the settlement is not affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, HomeServices intends to vigorously appeal on multiple grounds the jury’s findings and damage award in the Burnett case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action. The appeals process and further actions could take several years.

Other legal matters

In September 2024, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”) recorded a pre-tax charge of $490 million in connection with a settlement agreement reached concerning certain non-insurance affiliates that filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of bankruptcy code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Court”) in 2023. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, NICO has agreed to pay $535 million to the bankruptcy estate in consideration of a release of all estate causes of action against NICO and its affiliates. The settlement agreement, which is opposed by certain creditors, is subject to approval by the Court. NICO also accrued a recoverable of $45 million from a third party that is covered under the release, which was received in the fourth quarter.

Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that liabilities that may arise as a result of such other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Commitments

Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services in the future, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain materials purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2024, estimated future payments under those arrangements over the next five years were as follows: $12 billion in 2025, $6 billion in 2026, $5 billion in 2027, $4 billion in 2028, $3 billion in 2029, and thereafter $28 billion.

Note to Condensed Financial Information

As of December 31, 2024, Berkshire owned 27.2% of the outstanding shares of The Kraft Heinz Company common stock, which is accounted for pursuant to the equity method. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In September and October 2024, Berkshire acquired the remaining 2.12% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s (“BHE”) outstanding common stock held by noncontrolling shareholders in exchange for 2,291,631 shares of Berkshire Class B common stock valued at $1.045 billion. On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Alleghany Corporation for $11.5 billion. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2024, the Parent Company repaid approximately $1.9 billion of maturing senior notes. At various dates in 2024, Berkshire borrowed approximately ¥837.4 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) under senior note issuances and term loan agreements. The borrowings have interest rates ranging from 0.974% to 2.625% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2054. As of December 31, 2024, the Parent Company’s non-U.S. Dollar denominated borrowings included €4.6 billion and ¥1,988 billion par value senior notes. The gains and losses from the periodic remeasurement of these non-U.S. Dollar denominated notes due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are included in earnings.

Parent Company debt maturities in each of the next five years are as follows: 2025—$1.9 billion; 2026—$4.2 billion; 2027—$4.0 billion; 2028—$2.2 billion and 2029—$2.6 billion. The Parent Company guarantees certain debt of subsidiaries, which aggregated approximately $20.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and primarily consisted of debt issued by Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation. Such guarantees are an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations. The Parent Company has also provided guarantees in connection with certain retroactive reinsurance contracts issued by subsidiaries. The amounts of subsidiary payments under these contracts, if any, are contingent upon the outcome of future events.
